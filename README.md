# The Garden of the Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
This is a collection of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) markdown files which form the source for the [Digital Garden of Rob Burbea's Teachings](http://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea) (from here on call just "Digital Garden".)

This repository holds the files from the "work vault" of the Digital Garden. The files picked up by Obsidian Publish are contained in the [publish vault](https://github.com/fschuhi/digital-garden-workbench-publish), see the description of transformation process for the [Digital Garden Workbench](https://github.com/fschuhi/digital-garden-workbench).

The [_Hermes Amara Foundation_](mailto:hermes.amara@gmail.com) ("HAF") holds the rights to all of Rob's talks. HAF is a sangha-led organisation that was established to preserve and develop [Rob](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Rob+Burbea)'s vast Dharma teaching legacy.
