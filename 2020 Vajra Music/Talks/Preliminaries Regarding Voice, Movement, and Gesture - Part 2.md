![[20200302-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_2-62453.mp3#t=19:22]]

##### There are roads that are open
<span class="counts">**[[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[Soul]] (8) · [[Embodiment]] (4) · [[Music]]_</span>

---
##### (1) If soul wants to manifest, it can
<span class="counts">**[[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Soul]] (7) · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

What does it mean for movement/gesture/voice to be ensouled?
1. if soul wants to manifest, it can
2. ordinary usages of movement/gesture/voice can be sensed with soul

```ad-quote
So _if_ it wants to express and communicate through and using those aspects of being, if soul wants that, it _can_. ... There's not something that bars those directions and domains from being ensouled, bars soul from flowing through and expressing and communicating in and through and with those aspects of our being.
```

---
##### (2) Ordinary usages of movement/gesture/voice can be sensed with soul
<span class="counts">**[[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (3) · [[Soul]] (4) · [[Daimon]] (2) · [[Soulmaking]]_</span>

```ad-quote
A second thing that it means is that the movement, gesture, and voice of oneself or of another, in their everyday, ordinary usages - just the voice speaking, or just having a conversation, or exclaiming something, or the hand moving as it speaks, or whatever it is - those ordinary usages of movement, of gesture, of voice can be sensed with soul, can be sensed, therefore, as angelic, as refracting the [[Daimon|angel]], the daimon. 
```

##### I could have just kept bashing away, but I didn't
<span class="counts">**[[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Music]] · [[Pedagogy]]_</span>

```ad-quote
Yes, I wasn't taught it, because, as I said, there wasn't the [[pedagogy]] there at that time. But I could have just kept bashing away in this dogged way that one has if one really wants something. I didn't. I chose other things instead. So there's regret. There's some responsibility that falls on me.
```

---
##### So practice in a way that you don't end up regretting
<span class="counts">**[[0302 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Soulmaking]] (2) · [[Soul]] (3)_</span>

```ad-quote
In a way, I'm offering these particular teachings now, offering them so that there's the possibility that you can practise, and practise in a way that you don't end up regretting, that you don't end up regretting not supporting yourself fully, or allowing yourself or enabling yourself fully to move in the direction or be moved in the direction of what _you_ want with respect to [[Soulmaking|Soulmaking Dharma]], and also what you want with respect to [[soul]] in life, the expression and the living of soul in life, _your_ soul in _your_ life. We must call that Soulmaking Dharma; it's not something separate.
```

---

```ad-quote
you don't actually know what you're going to do. You just feel the impulse, and let that coalesce, and let it come out. Or it could be it's a precise move. You've rehearsed it, and you know exactly what it looks like and what it's going to sound like, and you do that. Those two alternatives will apply to all of these five examples.
```
- sponteneous
- rehearsed

=> up to fifteen seconds, then kind of gathering (citta, energy body, awareness), stopping, regrouping. Then another burst

```ad-quote
But I think even the ability to really read these things in another person and sense them is also quite rare ... For most people, it will probably only develop through practice and through doing it oneself. Then some people will develop the ability to sort of get a sense with other people. We can be easily misled in these areas, very easily misled.
```

Putting that piece in, the assessment, the sort of exam piece, actually makes it more difficult, usually, and more challenging, and that's actually part of it, because that reflects, mimics, the actual situation that [[soul]] finds itself in in life. Soul is in life. That's what we need to work with.
```

Beautiful as the [[experience]] of that week can be, or some of the experiences on that week can be, and touching, might it be that something more steady - courses, classes, groups, etc. - actually provide maybe not _more_ support, but a different kind of support, and a necessary kind of support for making a real, more long-term difference in terms of [[soul]] and soulmaking and what soul needs? That's something to think about.
