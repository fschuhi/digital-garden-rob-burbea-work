##### It's going to be about movement, gesture, and voice

```ad-quote
But again, how many people will actually take that out, and extract it, and capitalize on it, and repeat it, isolate it and repeat it as something, as a practice, as a set of instructions that are developable, remains to be seen.
```

---
##### ==Make a set of instructions==
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[Sangha]]_</span>

![[20200301-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_1-62452.mp3#t=09:23]]

```ad-quote
One could, if one gets really interested in this stuff, go back to all those talks, and listen again, and listen to what's being said in the background, and those instructions that one might miss. Take the material out. Extract it. Write it down. Make a set of instructions. Start practising it. So there's an invitation there.

In which way is this relevant for the Custodians?

### Condensing
##### ==Is it possible to listen more actively?==
<span class="counts">[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^4-3|4-3]]</span>

![[20200301-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_1-62452.mp3#t=17:00]]

```ad-quote
But still, when you listen to this, this set of talks, when you listen to talks that have already been given - maybe by me; maybe by another teacher - is it possible to <i>think</i> about listening more actively?
```

---
##### ==Actively extract meditations, exercises, from what's being said==
<span class="counts">[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^4-4|4-4]]</span>

```ad-danger
title: Think about that
In which way is this relevant for the Custodians?
```

---
##### ==Actively extract larger principles==
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[Conceptual framework]] · [[History]]_</span>

---
##### Example: the concept of "inertia"
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Meditation]] · [[Retreat]] (2) · [[Gaia House]] · [[Jhanas]] (2) · [[Inertia]] (5) · [[Dharma]] · [[Mind]]_</span>

```ad-warning
title: Interesting
see below, inertia is an important concept
```

---
##### Listening to talks together
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Meditation]] (2)_</span>

![[20200301-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_1-62452.mp3#t=21:14]]

```ad-tip
Could that be a routine agenda topic in the HAF yogis meetings?
```

##### Receptive listening tills the soil of the soul
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Active listening]] (3) · [[Soul]] (2) · [[Retreat]]_</span>

---
##### Seeing That Frees is often read too fast, without doing the practices
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Seeing That Frees]] · [[Mind]] · [[Inertia]] (5) · [[Active listening]]_</span>

---
##### Listening with blinders on
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Inertia]]_</span>

---
##### Listening is automatically sifting for significance
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Soul]] (2) · [[Consciousness]]_</span>

---
##### So be careful that topics might be not central but still are significant
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Soulmaking]] · [[Imaginal]] · [[Image]] (4)_</span>

---
##### Wisely assessing significance is hard
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Imaginal]] (2) · [[Image]] (3)_</span>

---
##### ==Structural listening==
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Dharma]] (2) · [[Seeing That Frees]] · [[Conceptual framework]] (7) · [[Insight]] · [[Soulmaking]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Conventional reality]] (2)_</span>

```ad-quote
What would it be to listen or read _for_ and _from_ the whole conceptual framework? I'm listening _for_, or I'm reading _for_, to get a sense of, what is the whole conceptual framework. And then, when I think I have that, I'm listening _from_ the perspective of the whole conceptual framework. And that listening _from_ an understanding of the whole conceptual framework, holding it there, it frames my listening...
```

---
##### Because I understand where things are and how they work, I can find them a lot easier
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Conceptual framework]] (2)_</span>

##### Inquiry into inertia is important

##### Where's the inertia?
<span class="counts">**[[0301 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Inertia]] (6) · [[Meditation]] · [[Steadiness]]_</span>

```ad-quote
Now, I would say that that inquiry into inertia, even though we're not really going into it at the moment [laughs] - again, I'm postponing it, or just mentioning it; I don't know if I'll ever get back to it - I would actually say that's _more_ important as a teaching, as an inquiry, structurally it's more important, at the meta-level it's more important than anything else that I might say in this set of talks about movement and gesture or anything else.

Then out of that comes a kind of mode of practising - effectively a technique (although one tries to think of it as _not_ a technique, because one isn't struggling, or supposedly not struggling and doing, and not thinking, etc., and it's non-dual). The idea is that it's open, but actually, it ends up being very closed, because we've cut off a bunch of possibilities...
