<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^1-3|1-3]]**: _[[Blessing]] (4) · [[Retreat]] · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[Soul]] (4) · [[Blessing]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Attention]] (2)_</span>

```ad-quote
So letting the movement/gesture/vocalization shape the action in time, as it goes, playing it by ear, so to speak, or creating the pottery, whatever you're making on the potter's wheel. Creating it as you're going, through the feel of it, through the feedback you're getting, through the signals of soul and of blessedness and blessingness that are coming back to you.
```

---
##### What helps to be in Mode 2?
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Soulmaking]] · [[Imaginal]] · [[Soul]] · [[Blessing]]_</span>
- slow down the movements
- pause in between movements
- rhythm

```ad-quote
What's the kind of rhythm that allows me to read, to sense, to be attuned and receptive to the sense of [[Soul|soulfulness]] in the moment...
```

---
##### It's just like doing walking meditation (pacing)

```ad-quote
[W]e're letting that intention lead us, and just starting the movement, and kind of reading it, surfing the whole situation, responding with our receptivity, with our sensitivity, responding to what we sense in terms of the [[Soul|soulfulness]] and the blessingness, and letting that shape the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations we're doing. So we're letting the body and the [[energy body]] and the sense of the soulfulness in the moment guide the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations...
```
---

#### Voice
##### We usually use voice to communicate something
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Image]]_</span>

---
##### Mantras also don't necessarily have particular meaning either
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Mantra practice]] (3) · [[Avalokiteshvara]] (3) · [[Compassion]] (5) · [[Seed syllables]] · [[Om mani padme hum]]_</span>

---
##### What if the sound itself was sensed with soul?
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Blessing]] (3) · [[Soul]] (2)_</span>

---
##### There is a level of (the sounds of) my voice that transcends meaning
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Soulmaking]] · [[Music]] · [[Soul]] (3) · [[Unfathomability]] · [[Dimensionality]] (2)_</span>

---
##### Dimensionality comes from both meaning and mystery
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Dimensionality]] · [[Image]] (6) · [[Unfathomability]] (2)_</span>

---

![[20200304-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_4-62455.mp3#t=18:21]]

```ad-quote
The meaning of this and the dimensionality, or the meaning of this and the sensing with soul of what's opened up through the meaning of what's being said in my voice, but also the dimensions that are opened up just through the sound, through the [[music]] of it, the mystery of it, the miracle of hearing and of sound. This particular sound, right now. This particular music. Different than other musics. Unique, particular.
```

---
##### In 4.1.x there is still meaning, in 4.2 we are opening up dimensionality and go beyond meaning
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Soul]] (2) · [[Blessing]] · [[Dimensionality]] · [[Mantra practice]] (3)_</span>

##### Witness is just noticing (albeit by bringing the whole energy body into sensual relationship) 🟢
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Energy body]] (6) · [[Blessing]] · [[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Voice, Movement, and the Possibilities of Soul]] · [[Catherine McGee]] · [[Dyad]] · [[Soul]] · [[Emotions]]_</span>

---
##### Just noticing - it doesn't have to be this or that
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Experience]] · [[Energy body]]_</span>

---
##### In case of feeling uncomfortable, the blesser is allowing themselves to pause, sense the space they're in (Method 1)
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[The Self]] (2) · [[Energy body]] (3) · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

```ad-quote
Allowing yourself to stop, pause, and sense, and taking the pressure off that way, but remaining attentive and connected and alive and attuned to the experience of self, other, world, energy body, and emotional body. And then, perhaps, out of that, out of that sensitivity and attunement in the pause comes the instigation, the seed of the next movement or gesture or [vocalization].
```

---
##### Just keep going (Method 2)
<span class="counts">[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-1|6-1]]</span>

```ad-quote
You're not taking your hands off the clay on the potter's wheel.
```

---
##### Also for Method 2, sense what you're doing
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Soul]] · [[Energy]] · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

---
##### I'm just tuning in and sensing as it rolls along, and I follow, soulfully
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Embodiment]] · [[Soul]]_</span>

```ad-quote
I'm letting the material shape the creation, rather than the sort of pause in the inner sense and silence.
```

---
#### Self-judgement
##### There might be self-consciousness arising
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[The Self]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Fear]] (3) · [[History]] · [[Soul]] · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Anxiety]] (3) · [[Consciousness]] · [[Awareness]]_</span>

```ad-quote
The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of [[anxiety]], or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the [[awareness]]. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help.
```

---
##### Opening up counteracts the contraction that's inherent in self-consciousness
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[The Self]] (6) · [[Nature]] · [[Contraction]] (4) · [[Attention]] (6) · [[Consciousness]] · [[Awareness]] (3) · [[Anxiety]] · [[Energy body]]_</span>

---
##### Set up the temenos in the beginning and include metta
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Fear]] (3) · [[Metta]] (4) · [[Compassion]] (2) · [[Dyad]] (2) · [[Temenos]] (4) · [[The Self]] · [[Anxiety]]_</span>

---
##### Also add metta in an adhoc fassion to counteract self-consciousness
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Metta]] (6) · [[Compassion]] (6) · [[Fear]] · [[Dyad]] · [[The Self]]_</span>

---
##### Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Perception]] (2) · [[Dyad]] · [[Soul]] (6) · [[Contraction]] · [[The Self]] (2)_</span>

![[20200304-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_4-62455.mp3#t=33:29]]

```ad-quote
Because when there's sensing with soul, it will tend to counter that kind of reified and [[Contraction|contracted]] [[The Self|self-consciousness]], self-obsession, because that's not really a soul-movement. It may be a kind of squeezed, impoverished reflection of what's, if you like, originally a soul-movement, but in itself, it's not. So when we sense with soul, something opens that out.
```

---
##### Place the affliction in the sight of the angels
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^8-1|8-1]]**: _[[The Self]] (2) · [[Daimon]] (5) · [[Soul]] (3) · [[Image]] · [[Imaginal]]_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^8-3|8-3]]**: _[[Fullness of intention]] (3) · [[Soul]] (7) · [[Eros]] (2) · [[Soulmaking]] (3) · [[Desire]] (2)_</span>

---
##### Remind yourself: It's an excercise, not a performance
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^8-4|8-4]]**: _[[Soul]] · [[Sangha]] · [[The Self]]_</span>

---
#### What can happen from Excercise 4
##### Something in the larger constellation may ignite and become image
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Embodiment]] · [[Image]] · [[Divinity]] (2) · [[Imaginal]] (5) · [[Soul]] · [[The Self]]_</span>

---
##### It can be a fully imaginal image without being necessarily clear or well-defined
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[Image]] (7) · [[Imaginal]] (3) · [[Soulmaking]] (2) · [[The Self]] · [[Blessing]]_</span>

---
##### When one constitutent of the larger constellation ignitates, then it's possible that the whole then ignites
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^9-3|9-3]]**: _[[Image]] · [[Imaginal]] · [[Soul]] (3) · [[Soulmaking]]_</span>

---
#### Variation on Excercise 4
##### Rather than actual person, dyad partner is intrapsychic image
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^9-5|9-5]]**: _[[Dyad]] (4) · [[Image]] (3) · [[Personhood]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Daimon]] (3) · [[Imaginal]] · [[Blessing]]_</span>

![[20200304-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_4-62455.mp3#t=43:31]]

```ad-quote
You're doing this in dyadic relationship with an image. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the body and make gestures and vocalize to the [[Daimon|angel]], to your angel who is your dyad partner, to the image there, to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the [[blessing]] and just the mystery of that communication from the angel, in your imagination.
```

---
##### Move/gesture/vocalize physically concretized, or just in the energy body
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-1|10-1]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Daimon]] · [[Image]] (2) · [[Energy body]] · [[Imaginal]] (2)_</span>

---
##### Why do it with an imaginal dyad partner?
<span class="counts">[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-2|10-2]]</span>

![[20200304-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-preliminaries_regarding_voice_movement_and_gesture_part_4-62455.mp3#t=45:50]]

---
##### Less chance of self-consciousness arising if we do it with an imaginal dyad partner (Reason 1)
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-3|10-3]]**: _[[The Self]] (2) · [[Meditation]] · [[Imaginal]] · [[Personhood]]_</span>

---
##### Also, the practice can become more subtle (Reason 2)
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-4|10-4]]**: _[[Imaginal]] (3) · [[Dyad]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Soulmaking]]_</span>

```ad-quote
So we really want to keep that range of things, the more subtle range, open, and keep exploring it - not at the exclusion of the grosser, but just a reminder that sometimes the more subtle is actually the more powerful and the more fertile and the more profound.
```

---
##### Can increase the range of what we're doing (Reason 3)
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-5|10-5]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Perception]] · [[Soul]] · [[Personhood]] · [[Dimensionality]]_</span>

---
##### Some soul-secrets might be for the ears of the angel only (Reason 4)
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^10-6|10-6]]**: _[[Personhood]] (2) · [[Image]] · [[Imaginal]] · [[Soul]] (5) · [[Daimon]] (6) · [[Soulmaking]] (2) · [[Materialism]] (2) · [[Dimensionality]] · [[Nature]]_</span>

---
##### Magick is not soulmaking
<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^11-2|11-2]]**: _[[Soulmaking]] (2) · [[Fullness of intention]] (3) · [[The Self]] (2)_</span>

```ad-quote
Usually when the intention goes into that kind of thing, that's when I'm seeking information; usually that information is for the sake of a reified self, and what this self can get, or how it can aggrandize itself in some way. (...) The fullness of intention is a much more powerful, much more primal, fundamental, beautiful, sacred intention than these other intentions that are more to do with a reified self, and power, and what it can get, etc.
```

<span class="counts">**[[0304 Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#^14-1|14-1]]**: _[[Via Dolorosa]] · [[Energy body]] (2) · [[Soul]]_</span>

```ad-quote
We're not interested in an exercise in acting, in developing our acting skills. We're not interested, **therefore**, in what it looks like to an outside observer. That, what it looks like to an outside observer, is much less important than your [[Energy Body|sense of the energy body]], the emotional body, and the [[Soul|soul-sense]] of what's happening, okay? 
```
```ad-question
Doesn't the **therefore** point to a rather limited definition of what acting is?

But actually to hold a fully authentic imaginal image, and be in relation to that image, and dance at the same time, in a way that both the dancing and the image, the soulfulness of both and the sensing with soul of both, is kind of mutually enhanced and mutually woven together and implicated, that's quite hard for most people - even most people who have a practice of dance, etc., and of the imaginal.

Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the [[image]], that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole [[Gestalt Psychology|gestalt]], the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole image, that whole time, that icon, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the body [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, voice]], or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed.

We want soul to be able to come through there as soul wants to come through there, so that we _can_ follow our [[telos]], we _can_ discharge our [[duty]], we _can_ carry that out, we _can_ have a fuller sense of ourselves, sense ourselves with soul, sense our life with soul, our work, our duty, our relationships, our being, the aspects of our being.
