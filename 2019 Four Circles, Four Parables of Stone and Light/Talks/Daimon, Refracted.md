##### All views of the self are empty, which legitimizes playing with them

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=00:00]]

```ad-quote
because _everything_ is empty, and there is no sort of hidden, basic, building block reality or fundament that is not empty, where it leaves a person, seeing that, is it opens up any and all views of self as kind of legitimate views and concepts to play with
```

##### Possibilities: self as process, oneness, angel

##### We are free to entertain any sense of self

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=04:52]]

```ad-quote
when we talk about the _imaginal_ Middle Way, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of the self, a dissolving, a disappearing, a fading of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way.
```

##### It's formed, but it's theatre

```ad-quote
You know this is not real, what's happening in front of you, but it affects you, and it can effect a transformation in your being, a transformation in your life, in your heart, in your soul, in your view of things, in your aspirations, in your desires
```

---
##### The imaginal Middle Way is more a boulevard

##### Soul wants self, other, and world to become image

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=12:40]]

```ad-quote
if we don't get in the way, if we allow soul to do what it wants to do (which is to make more soul), then self and world, as well as this other, will become soul.
```

##### Any order is possible

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=14:43]]

```ad-quote
we want to get a sense that the waters of soul are allowed to flow all ways, all those three ways - self, other, world. The order is not important.
```

---
##### Any aspect of our being can be drawn into the soulmaking dynamic

##### Externalizing the self who loves this or that
<span class="counts">**[[0530 Daimon, Refracted#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Soul]] · [[Desire]] (9) · [[Eros]] (2) · [[The Self]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (3)_</span>

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=17:47]]

---
##### Let that he/she/they become image
<span class="counts">**[[0530 Daimon, Refracted#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Love]] (5) · [[Desire]] (4) · [[Eros]] (2) · [[The Self]] · [[Dukkha]] · [[Image]] (2)_</span>

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=20:03]]

---
##### Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that
<span class="counts">**[[0530 Daimon, Refracted#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Love]] · [[Desire]] · [[Eros]] (5) · [[Image]] (4) · [[Imaginal]] (4) · [[Beauty]] (3) · [[Dimensionality]]_</span>

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=21:21]]

```ad-quote
We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there.
```

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=24:59]]

```ad-quote
So as the imaginal grows, the _papañca_ diminishes. As the _papañca_ grows, the imaginal diminishes.
```

##### The image included Blackbird _and_ the self

##### It is and it is more than "I have this quality"

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=31:01]]

```ad-quote
Sometimes you get an image which is not so much a narrative image as much as it has a kind of backstory. It has a kind of imaginal background. So one understands, almost actually implicitly - not like watching a series of events, but one understands implicitly the story or the narrative
```

---
##### The queen became a common object among the yogi and Rob

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=34:53]]

```ad-quote
One opens one's being to those particular qualities, and the being, the soul, the energy body, the emotions start resonating with those qualities. And in so doing, we absorb those qualities. We absorb, if you like, into our life in ways that can actually then become manifest, practically manifest, really manifest, in our real, physical relationships, over time.
```

##### But the image is not here just to serve me; I am serving the image

```ad-quote
if my energy body becomes ethereal, it's not the same as melting in union and losing the twoness, losing the differentiation between self and image
```

---
##### The particular kind of exquisiteness were mirrored in the image
<span class="counts">**[[0530 Daimon, Refracted#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Image]] (2) · [[Soul]] (2) · [[Blessing]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Daimon]] (2)_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[0530 Daimon, Refracted#^8-1|8-1]]**: _[[Middle Way]] · [[Soul]] · [[Stories]] · [[Image]] (4) · [[Daimon]] (2) · [[The Self]] (3) · [[Duty]]_</span>

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=44:08]]

```ad-quote
So the image is brought into a very powerful relationship with the self, but it's got all the lightness - I mean, partly helped by the ethereality - but it's got all the lightness of touch of non-identification, or not _over_-identifying, put it that way, and making a rigid ego-identity around it. So there's the duty wrapped up in it, and the sense of self, and the way this image then informs and flows into the self.
```

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=48:35]]

```ad-quote
My soul is informed, has the impression, has the stamp of these deep soul-images - Coltrane, Hendrix, this friend or that friend, etc. And I treasure that. I treasure that. I _want_ to be impressed upon in that way. I want to be impressed upon. Don't we, as souls, _want_ to be impressed upon by soul, and by what is soulful?
```

##### The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real

![[20190530-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-daimon_refracted-58766.mp3#t=51:02]]

```ad-quote
The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon.
```

something else wants to happen. Partly what allows it to happen is to conceive it in a way that gives it some respect, and believes there's a treasure there, believes there's a necessity of soul there.

So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "the angel out ahead."

When the inner critic is badgering us and kind of taking over and hounding us, all the power, or most of the power, has gone _there_. So there is this psyche with its complexity, this self with its complexity, this soul with its complexity, and all the power of that soul seems to be kind of gathered under the purview and domain of that inner critic, and the rest of the being feels weak, collapsed, etc., lacking in power.

So sometimes connecting with an image and recognizing, feeling, opening to its love for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the dimensionality and the divinity and the beauty, etc., that, in a way, that kind of love, the love that images have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned love, it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else.
