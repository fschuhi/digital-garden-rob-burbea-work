[[What is Insight -|plain list]]

### Intro
##### This talk is about putting things in place
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-2|1-2]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Meditation]] · [[Conceptual framework]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=00:02]]

---
##### Different personality types react differently to conceptual frameworks
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-3|1-3]]**: _[[Personality types]] (2) · [[Conceptual framework]] · [[Dharma]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=00:57]]

---
##### Talking about the deep end of the path can feel daunting
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Dharma]] (3) · [[Insight]] · [[Personality types]] · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Mind]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=01:50]]

---
### Definition
##### General definition of insight: that which brings lessening of suffering
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Insight]] (12) · [[Dukkha]] (7) · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Meditation]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=03:15]]

```ad-quote
So any seeing or understanding that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of dukkha - that's what we call "insight." Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just intellectual understanding, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of suffering, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an insight.
```
```ad-quote
Any situation, any experience, you can apply insight to, insight is relevant.
```

---
##### Example: talking to someone in an accusing way
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Insight]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=04:46]]

<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Habit]] (4) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Mind]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=06:17]]

##### Be really alive in your inquiry into your personal tendencies
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Habit]] (2) · [[Insight]] · [[Dukkha]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=07:30]]

---
##### Be aware of both personal weaknesses and strenghts
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^2-5|2-5]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Metta]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Steadiness]] · [[Psychological maturity]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=08:24]]

---
##### Example: being more in touch with the heart vs the mind
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[Beauty]] · [[Emotions]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=09:01]]

```ad-quote
Just to know, what's the weakness, what's the strength, what needs some work? What's a strength? Do we know, do we acknowledge and appreciate our strengths?
```

---
##### Are the personal stories we tell ourselves helpful or unhelpful?
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Personhood]] · [[Stories]] (7) · [[Fantasy]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=10:11]]

---
##### It's not easy to navigate and inquire into those stories
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Stories]] (2) · [[Healing]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=11:18]]

```ad-quote
Is the story helpful? And if so, how? And is it not helpful? And if so, how? And is it possible to actually tell myself a different story, to rewrite my story? And actually, yes, that is possible.
```

---
##### No story can ever be the whole truth
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Freedom]] · [[Stories]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=12:39]]

```ad-quote
Any story we have of ourselves can never, even if it's very beautiful, even if it's very compelling, even if it seems completely obvious, it can never be the whole truth. There's no way. Truth as such is bigger than anything you can fit it into.
```

---
#### (2) Universal insights
##### Universal insights pertain to all beings and all things
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^3-6|3-6]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] · [[Habit]] · [[Impermanence]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=13:35]]

```ad-quote
So most obvious example would be impermanence. It's just true for everyone and all things.
```
```ad-warning
"universal insights" <> "ultimate insights", i.e. index entry is wrong
```

---
##### Personal and universal truths help us to respond well to conventional reality
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] (5) · [[Insight]] (4) · [[Embodiment]] (4) · [[Feelings]] · [[Mind]] (2) · [[Relationships]] (3) · [[Conventional reality]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=14:04]]

```ad-warning
add more "world of" index entries
```

---
#### (3) Ultimate truth
##### Ultimate truth is beyond words, transcends any of the other
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Awakening]] · [[Insight]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=15:45]]

---
##### Do we give equal attention to the conventional and the ultimate?
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Attention]] (2) · [[Conventional reality]] (4) · [[Ultimate Truth]] (2) · [[Spiritual circles]] (2) · [[Habit]] · [[Relationships]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Feelings]] · [[Healing]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=16:10]]

---
#### More on universal insights
##### Another universal insight: it's a good idea to practice
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-4|4-4]]**: _[[Ultimate Truth]] · [[Insight]] (3) · [[Dukkha]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=17:31]]

---
##### It's a good idea to practice generosity
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[Insight]] (2) · [[Generosity]] (2) · [[Happiness]] · [[Buddha]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=18:12]]

```ad-quote
This is an insight, to really care what I put out into the world, the vibrations that I'm putting out there, what's reverberating in my wake.
```

---
##### What qualities do I need to cultivate that actually lead to a lessening of suffering
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Ethics]] (2) · [[Generosity]] (2) · [[Metta]] · [[Insight]] (3) · [[Happiness]] · [[Pleasantness]] · [[Cultivation]] · [[Dukkha]] · [[Ultimate Truth]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=19:12]]

```ad-quote
universal insights, they're not one-off insights.
```
```ad-quote
Actually we need to see this over and over and over and over and over, until finally the coin drops, and seeing it over and over, and practicing it, it deepens. The insight deepens and becomes unshakeable, becomes unshakeable.
```

---
##### Unshakeable knowing is pretty rate
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-2|5-2]**: _[[Personhood]] · [[Insight]] (4) · [[Devotion]] · [[Generosity]] · [[Meditation]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=20:28]]

---
### Insight practice
#### Insights as results
##### "Insights arise", often from trusting mindfulness
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Dharma]] (4) · [[Insight]] (5) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Mindfulness]] (6) · [[Attention]] · [[Present moment]] · [[Mind]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=21:24]]

---
##### Taking care of insight through taking care of ethics and samadhi
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Buddha]] · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Ethics]] (2) · [[Steadiness]] (2) · [[Samadhi]] (3)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=22:43]]

---
#### Acting on insights
##### "Insights arising" vs "using insights"
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-5|5-5]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Retreat]] (2) · [[Metta]] · [[Letting go]] · [[Impermanence]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=23:05]]

```ad-quote
Usually, though, it takes some acting on. You actually need to consolidate it.
```

---
##### To consolidate the insight needs us to act on it
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^5-6|5-6]]**: _[[Retreat]] · [[Insight]] (4) · [[Perception]] (2) · [[Love]] · [[Impermanence]] · [[Devotion]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=24:20]]

---
##### Insight is like a muscle, if we don't use it it will atrophy
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Insight]] (4) · [[Habit]] · [[Love]] (2) · [[Generosity]] · [[Emptiness]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=25:35]]

```ad-quote
Insight is a bit like a muscle. If we don't use it, it will atrophy. We need to kind of keep it alive, to consolidate it.
```
```ad-info
check out some thing, or the other.
```

---
#### Using an insight as a lens
##### Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Insight]] (3) · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Conceptual framework]] · [[Impermanence]] (3) · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Ways of looking]] (2) · [[Retreat]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=26:23]]

```ad-quote
Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time
```

---
##### Insight as result vs insight as a process
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Insight]] (5) · [[Personality types]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=27:56]]

```ad-quote
So some people always want to just "be," and just let things arise, and some people are always kind of probing and trying to look differently, or a tendency either way. Both are important, and I would say, maybe not just one way.
```

---
##### Looking at things through certain modes of seeing as insight calms the being
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Ways of looking]] (2) · [[Impermanence]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Breath]] (2) · [[Emotions]] · [[Insight]] · [[Steadiness]] · [[Samadhi]] · [[Mind]]_</span>

---
##### Whenever there is dukkha, the unawakened mind does something unnecessary to itself
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (9) · [[Samadhi]]_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (3) · [[Pain]] · [[Aversion]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=33:17]]

---
#### (1) Impermanence
##### Impermanence is an obvious fact, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-1|8-1]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (3) · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Attention]] · [[Beauty]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=35:40]]

```ad-quote
Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come.
```

---
##### Using impermance as a lense
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-2|8-2]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (6) · [[Insight]] · [[Mindfulness]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=36:56]]

---
##### "Take up the theme": seeing impermanence in visual forms, emotions, body sensations, sounds
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-3|8-3]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (4) · [[Buddha]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Consciousness]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=37:42]]

```ad-quote
Just going through and just focusing on impermanence so that the fact of impermanence begins to impress itself deeply, deeply on the consciousness. And we begin more and more to be able to live that way.
```

---
##### You contemplate impermance in the right way, it brings joy
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-4|8-4]]**: _[[Letting go]] · [[Freedom]] (3) · [[Happiness]] (2) · [[Impermanence]] · [[Ways of looking]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=38:37]]

```ad-quote
So you're actually using it in the moment as a way of feeling into freedom, of opening up into freedom. It's a way of seeing, a way of looking.
```

---
##### Reflection on death
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-5|8-5]]**: _[[Death]] (2) · [[Freedom]] · [[Happiness]] · [[Love]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=39:10]]

---
##### Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul", but I don't think that's how insight works
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^8-6|8-6]]**: _[[Impermanence]] (5) · [[Commentaries]] (2) · [[Buddha]] · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Freedom]] (3) · [[Happiness]] · [[Ways of looking]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=39:33]]

```ad-quote
So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom. If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion, existentially or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else.
```

---
#### (2) Dukkha
##### Seeing things as unsatisfactory
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Freedom]] (2) · [[Happiness]] · [[Impermanence]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Experience]] · [[Aversion]] · [[Letting go]] (2)_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=40:43]]

```ad-quote
What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go.
```

---
##### Learn to relax the push and the pull
<span class="counts">**[[1229 What is Insight#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[Dukkha]] · [[Insight]] · [[Aversion]] (4) · [[Craving]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

![[20071229-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-what_is_insight-11972.mp3#t=43:38]]

```ad-quote
It's "not me, not mine." And in that, there's a letting go, a very beautiful letting go. It's not at all about disconnection, dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practicing a mode of seeing, a certain lens.
```

---
##### Just letting go of the aversion in the heart, the heart opens

There's a kind of radiance that begins to come into one's experience, the more that we're able to meet it in a very direct, very simple, bare way
