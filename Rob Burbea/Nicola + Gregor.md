### new kind of HAF meeting
pass on some thoughts Adam and I have been discussing concerning a new kind HAF meeting (as touched upon in the "all HAF meeting" on June 24th)

- obvious question: how does any meeting activity fit into the broader spectrum of what's already happening?
- immediate result: signing up for
	- Facebook groups (PoP, GtH)
	- monthly dependend origination practice and Q&A meeting
	- shaping the world
- since then there's also now also the biweekly HAF practice meeting - - which is wonderful.
- seminars
	- Adam and I both agree that having HAF-wide Zoom seminars for exploring Rob's teaching could be interesting as well - - there's probably the Custodian speaking in me here, though.
	- Those seminars could be either adhoc or in form of a short talk, as part of the biweekly gathering. Still, that's not what Adam pointed to in his original suggestion.
- meta-level meetins
	- **Adam's original idea** was a bit different, though: how to apply Rob's teachings to HAF, i.e. a kind of meta level meeting.
	- For the a meta level meeting, though, there is probably neither enough material nor interest to fill a regularly recurring meeting => quarterly cadence could be about right.
- all HAF planned?
	- Again, it could be more fruitful to incorporate a short talk in a "All HAF" meeting. We had one about 3 months ago - - are there plans to do this regularly?
	
It was really nice to talk to someone from HAF, outside the regulated meeting format. I feel much closer to Adam now, of course. He's currently moving to Stockholm, so I'll let him settle and continue talking to him then.

I'll have a call probably later tonight. 

=> Any feedback here for Adam and me?


### Metta book project
give you an update on where the Custodians stand with regard to the current book project on metta

- Initially, Mary wanted to work a book about the imaginal, based on selected talks of Rob. They have to be edited, though, and there was not much clarity about what where the rules of the game, if you will.
- Then Arjuna came on with the idea to compile a book from the 2017 Eros Unfettered talks. We therefore decided to put a bit more weight on those.
- We then had a meeting with Mark Ovland. He clued us in about which books Rob did actually plan to publish, based on which talks. Awesome!
- Mary and Karen are both authors and editors, so there's a lot of know-how and dedication. They picked up the first talk in the list of Metta talks and did a first edit.
- In our last meeting (which is always the last Wednesday of a month) we compared both versions, also contrasted them with original edits from Rob and longer, more thorough edits from Mark.
- Karen and Mary are working on the next edit now, to get into the groove, also collect ideas how to distribute the workload.
- I'm not a native English speaker, so we decided to use me as sounding board, proof reader, technical help desk, also to add the Metta talks to the Digital Garden - - I'll talk about this in a second.
- Padraig is working on practice guides, distilled from Rob's talks. I'll show you an example later in this talk. He'll turn to the Metta talks and start extracting the excercises and guided meditations, like the boxes in STF.

What are your thoughts on a Metta book?
- Gregor: really happy


### Practice Guides for Seeing That Frees
- That's also where our idea came from: doing a high-quality, visually appealing practice guide for STF, by putting the practice boxes from the end of chapters into a PDF.
- There wouldn't be much editing involved, in my opinion. The practice guides are pretty much self-contained.
- It would give HAF the option to publish a PDF from STF, without actually publishing the full STF.
- The custodians wanted me to ask you if we can explore this further, or if that constitutes a no-go-area

How do you think about such a STF practice guide PDF?

==TODO==
- little proposal
- suggested uses, ideas for use
- any other things to insert, to make it more userfriendly?
