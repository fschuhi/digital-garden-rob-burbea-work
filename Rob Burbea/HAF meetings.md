- I thought a bit about the seed question, and the thoughts quickly proliferated - - it's an interesting question.
- I wrote something about it and I'd like to read a summary of that to you.
- **Seed question: What freedom(s) have you acquired in your life that you would like to celebrate today?**

#### where I come from
- I've been always drawn towards the sciences, towards exploring the world with scientific methods. 
- For a long time, I have to admit, this was accompanied by a thorough skepticism towards what I relegated to be outside those domains.
- On the other hand, I have always been fascinated by mystical depths and heights, of what's possible in life.
- Below the radar of my surface self, I think there had always been a fantasy of a freedom of creativity, operating both in the material and in the magical.

#### phenomenology
- For a while now I've been giving me exactly that freedom to explore.
- Rob calls this "the phenomenological approach". 
- With being able and being free to observe what is actually happening in experience, exciting territories open up.
- More degrees of freedom to participate in being alive.
- And Rob's emptiness teachings and their extension towards imaginal practice and notions of soulmaking are lightening up that path.

#### freedoms, acquired
- The freedom to use multiple lenses and stacking them on top of each other.
- The freedom to admit to myself that I long for reaching out towards the divine.

#### freedoms, received
- And the freedom to be able to talk about those freedoms.
- Gratitude for the freedom to be allowed to express myself in that way.
- Be this person, hear, today.
- Gratitude for the freedoms I enjoy, being free from hunger, pain, dispair.
- Grateful for the freedoms gifted to me by others, by my wife, my parents, friends, society.
- That's something to celebrate.

- I'm Frank, hailing from Hanover, Germany.
- I celebrate Rob's explorations of the spectrum of what _clinging_ does, and how both non-clinging _and_ skillful clinging can open up paths towards freedom.
- Yes, as he said one one of his retreats: No objects, no problems.
- But no objects would also mean no perception, so perceiving and clinging and beautiful objects and beautiful soul go hand in hand.
- So both letting go, as well as touching something deeply.
- There is depth and sacredness in this, and this is something worth celebrating.
- Padraig: marriage between scope and precision
- unfabricating is a gateway, not an endpoint but an opening towards beauty and unfathomability
