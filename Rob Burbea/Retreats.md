# The Garden of the Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
```ad-quote
So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something.

_(a quote from the talk [[Love and Emptiness#Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation|Love and Emptiness]])_
