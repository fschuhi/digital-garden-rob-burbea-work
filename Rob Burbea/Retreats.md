# Garden of Soul: Rob Burbea's Teachings
```ad-quote
This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of .. the vast unknown of death. So in a way can we contemplate the infinite every day, can we contemplate death every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards equanimity, moving towards freedom.

_a quote from the talk '[[Equanimity (talk)#This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death|Equanimity (talk)]]'_
