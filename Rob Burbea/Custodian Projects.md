What does "Custodianship" mean to me?

From HAF final.pdf
> Custodianship will include delineating the entire body of work as unique and distinct from other traditions and pradigms and preservign the original material in its various forms.
> This Circle will work towards maintaining, cataloguing, centralising and disseminating this body of work. Integrating this process with the development of digital platforms.

Maintaining, cataloguing, centralising
- [[Dharmaseed]]
- [[AirTable]]
- Transcripts as corpus => [[Explain the Digital Garden]]

Disseminating
- [[STF German translation]]
- [[Metta book project]]
- [[Path of the Imaginal]]

- There are 2 aspects to Custodianship
	- static => Custodians
	- dynamic => Evoluation of the Teachings

### How to do we work together?
- sense of purpose starting to form
- How often should we meet? => once a month, w/o Doodle
- attendence: I believe we've lost 1 member already, still 5
- should  we actually work together? Or is a "personal project" type of approach more adequate?
- different opinions, potentially different claims on each other over time (taking notes, organising, attending meetings, also Bio project, sensitivity issues)
- how much time needs to be spent on tasks? short-term and eventually?
- role of technology
	- Slack: acceptance?
	- Google Drive
	- Notion, Mighty Network
	- organize tasks? (see S&P Notion)
	- Roam, Obsidian etc. => PKM
- Rob's Bio ... Casey wants to do other things, Pádraig works on practice guides

### ideas
- Practice guides 
	- à la [[Reddit]]
	- Pádraig: Vajra Music bullet list, Jhana Retreat
- catalogue the talks, with keywords, like [[AirTable]]
- Prioritising of the talks in terms of "fullness of evolution"
- ratings as orientation
- dictionary, index
- showcase introductory stuff, entry points, like [[Reddit]], "7 ways to enter the Imaginal"
- link to specific sections in the audio files
- list of guided meditations

### How do I see myself?
- working on coverage => be a specialist, be able to answer questions like the one recently asked on Slack (medical dhukkha)
- treat audio and transcripts as a corpus => NLP w/ Spacy
- someone who works on eliciting the structure from the talks, retreats, themes => linking, indexing => finding

### "Difficult" material
- sensitivity of issues, "difficult material" - - hide material? => no
- maybe meet with Catherine
- getting in touch with Tibetan teacher, to collect ideas how to deal with "secret" material

### What I would like to see?
- values
	- "Sangha"
	- "Relational Work"
	- "Commitment to Practice"
	- "A Sense of Lineage"
	- "Ways of Looking"
	- ... and "Co-creation and Participation"
=>  more Discussions of the teachings => consensus view
