## Themen, die ich ansprechen sollte
##### [[2021-09-29_Wed]]
- supports different ways to work with the material
	- transcript only (but can create lists of links to paragraphs, or point others directly to paragraphs and their context)
	- use the plain list of paragraphs to gain a quick overview about the themes
	-  talk page shows how the talk is embeddedin the overall semantic network
	- use practice guides (which point to transcripts and summaries)
	- explore concepts like [[Energy body]], following the links into the transcripts where it is used
- Transcript is the main artifact, can be used standalone, no visual cluttering by showing links to other places (except the keywords and fullstops for talk backlinks, see [[Add manual backlinks to transcript paragraphs]])

##### [[2021-09-26_Sun]]
- Warum überhaupt ein Digital Garden?
- Was macht den Garden garden-like?
- wie interagieren die Komponenten miteinander? mehr content für [[Gardening]]
- apropos [[Gardening]]: welche Rolle spielt der [[Index]]? Warum geht das nur automatisch?
- Auch ohne die Verlinkungen ist der Garden ein Garden
	- audio
	- page-paragraph links
	- Organisation der retreats/talk series
- was ist die übergreifende Bezeichnung? "semantic network"? Oder bleibe ich bei "Digital Garden"?
- "breadcrumbs"
	- dynamisch: "spines" right and left
	- 
- ==link types== (s.a. Gespräch mit Abdi)
	- link to a paragraph (show in yellow)
	- link to an "index term" => [[Terminology of the Digital Garden]]
	- backlinks, **warum erscheinen bei hoover nicht die backlinks?** (d.h. Unterschied statisch vs. dynamisch)
- page/note types
	- Wie sind bestimmte page/note types aufgebaut? headers?

### Digital Garden
- I'll use the actual Digital Garden prototype to explain what I mean with "Digital Garden".

[[Digital Gardens#Rob]]
- Point of departure was a [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1my-qnizw-9XKszhI6TCXsXuXpPChz_rayHlRV08fGXY/edit) document from Padraig. When he showed it to the Custodians, I had not listened that [[2020 Vajra Music]] series of talks.
- And when I did, I heard Rob calling me to action, right in the first talk.

[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#Condensing|"Condensing"]]
- Let's jump to the talk
- ==Is it ok if I play a clip from the talk?==
- The question for me was, how to do that, in a skillful way? How to _think_ about listing more actively?
- The Digital Garden I'm showing you right now and what I'm explaining a bit more in depth is a possible answer to this question.

Let's look at what we are seeing here
- The "4-3" tells us that it's on page 4 of the transcript PDF, the 3rd paragraph
- I've added a very short description for each paragraph. You can see and browse the overall outline of the talk on the right.
- By hoving over the 4-3 we see the actual text, coming from the transcript compiled by Shannon.
- A bit lower on the talk page, at 5-1 you see a bit longer paragraph. In the preview, some words are underlined. Those are index entries, also conveniently summaries in the list next to the 5-1.
- Inertia actually appears 5 times in the paragraph, so just by looking at the talk page we understand that this is probably an important in that paragraph.
- The "WARNING", like the Quote box and the IMPORTANT box are my comments. The idea is to really engage with the content of the talk, maybe also adding additional thoughts and references to other talks.

Let me click on the 5-1 to go to the transcript
- How we are looking at the complete transcipt.
- I had said that inertia occurs a couple of times - - it's only marked once, though, in order to not distract the reader.
- The talk referenced quite a lot of index entries

Let's look at a graphical overview:
- This is a view on the relations between the transcripts and index entries it links to.
- Some concepts are more connected than others.
- Let's take a look at equanimity.

[[Equanimity]]
- I've selected a number of talks and some quotes from those talks.
- Take the first one, it's from [[2006 New Year's Retreat]].
- We are looking now on the concept of Equanimity. That's not confined to the 2020 Vajra Music talks but appears of course elsewhere, too.
- If we quicky jump to the bottom of the page, you see the pages which refer to Equanimity. Those are the transcripts which mention equanimity.
- Again, Equanimity has its own local graph, showing the network of concepts.

Let's now revisit Padraig's [[Vajra Music Excercises (Pádraig)]]:
- Looking back to the Google Doc, I've just copied his texts.
- In addition to that, though, I've added links to the relevant transcript positions.
- You can also jump directly to the positions in the audio files, letting Rob personally explain the excercises.
- The ease of moving between the talk, transcript and Rob's spoken words adds another dimension to Padraig's guide.
- It's not something different, but it is certainly more useful and also more exciting than just reading a doc.
- Some of us yogis like to have visuals. That's easy to add, take a look at [[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1]]

==and now?==
- The garden is on the web. Nic and Gregor, I'll send you a DM with the link.
- Please keep in mind that it is a prototype. 
	- I've been working on this now for 2 months.
	- I'm learning the tools as I go. 
	- Not every concept might survive. There will be many more things to come. 
	- It's a Garden.
- So far, only the Custodians have seen an even earlier prototype, and they'll get an update in our next meeting, end of September.
- Content-wise, the focus will now go to the series of talks for the metta book. I'd like the Garden to support the editing work.
- For the time being, I am hesistant to spread it more widely. I tend to be a perfectionist, and inviting feedback and not being able to react swiftly would be emotionally painful.
- The Garden was a summer vacation experiment. I'll have to start working now, beginning next week. I don't know yet how fast I can add more content.
- Lastly, I am aware that something like this lives on the border between the Custodians and the Digital Platforms circle. It curates and presents the teachings, in an accessible way, but it does so using web technology.
- That's another reason why I wanted to present the prototype to you, so that you know that there's something happening at the border.
- I'm certainly looking forward to adding more time to gardening, and I hope that that will help the engagement with Rob's teachings, not only for me but also for others, of course.
