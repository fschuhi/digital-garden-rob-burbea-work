### Intro
- start w/ 150%
- This is the starting page of what we Custodians affectionately call the "Digital Garden": a collection of Rob's talks, 
	- based on the transcripts
	- with links to the Dharma Seed audio,
	- cross-referenced
	- organized
	- with keywords, phrases, terminology
	- notes and quotes
	- and many more tools
	- ...
- ... to easily
	- learn about Rob's teachings
	- on the web
	- browse the talks
	- search and find
	- access practice guides
	- understand and follow Rob's thoughts
- You can think about the Digital Garden as Rob's talks and voice, not just the PDFs and MP3 files, but as web page.
- I want to show you around for a few minutes
	- just to give you a feeling about what's possible
	- and as an invitation to come back later and check it out for yourself.
	- It's really easy to use.

### Daily Quote
- Take a look at the daily quote, pulled from one of his talks, "..."

##### hover
- Links to other parts of the Garden, to other pages in it are blue, here the name of the talk.
- Let's move the mouse to the name, without clicking on it.
- The Garden shows you a description of what this paragraph is about, "..."
- It's paragraph ... on page ... of the transcript PDF.
- Again, let's hover with the mouse, this time on the ...-....
- We now see the text of the paragraph, from the transcript.
- Let's listen to it.
- Links to other pages are blue, and you see a couple of words in the paragraph marked as blue.
- Those are keywords.
- You also see the the keywords above the audio player.
- It's a bit like a fingerprint of this paragraph: [counts]
- And below you see the quote.

##### context
- Let's put a bit more information on the screen, to see this paragraph in context.
- I decrease the zoom to get a bit more room on the right side.
- It's a bit like a book.
- I click on the talk from the quote, and it opens the talk page where we just peeked in when we hovered with the mouse.
- We also previewed the actual paragraph in the transcript, the one 9-2
- So not hover but let's click on that link now, to see the paragraph in contetx.
- The pages have turned, with the entry page hidden in the spine, the talk overview page still visible, now on the left, and on the right the full transcript.

##### transcript
- Of course you can read the whole transcript, without the need to do it from the paragraph descriptions.
- Just like you would read the PDF.
- But if you want to, you can always listen to Rob's voice.
- And there are the keywords, the words in blue, let's click on one of them.

##### keyword
- We are now looking at the Garden, not following the path of a talk, but looking through the door of a particular keyword.
- The Garden tells us in which talks ... appears the most.
- It also sifts through all the paragraphs and looks for mentionings of ...
- You remember when we looked at the quote, in the beginning, there were the keywords and [count] times ...? [too difficult]
- That's the count you see here, showing in the top spot of the table the one paragraph of all the paragraphs of all talks of all retreats where the term occurs the most.
- [[energy body]] - - maybe open one from [[2020 Vajra Music]], which looks nice and colorful
	- And all of the keywords have tables with the top mentionings.
	- And some of them even quote collections.
	- And even lists which show with which other keywords this particular keyword co-occurs most often, in which of the talks.
- STOP TALKING, JUST CLICK []
	- open it
	- play
	- click blockid
	- stop

##### going back
- Let's go back.
- We had looked at the quote of the day, and then the talk [click]
- The book flips back, with the path we just left on the right. [click] [click]
- And back to the entry page.
- I click on the top left, and we have a clean slate and can tak a fresh way through the Digital Garden.

##### Index
- We looked at a particular keyword in the transcript.
- You also have all the keywords, conveniently collected in one index.
- Just a very quick glance.
- There are
	- names
	- Buddhist terminology
	- and of course a whole bouquet of words which collectively support the network of Rob's thoughts.

##### Retreats
- Going back, just a quick look on the retreats in the Garden.
- The transfer of the transcripts into the Garden takes a while, and the Garden is only about 4 months old now.
- Expect to see more retrats.
- And tell me what you might want to see here!
- Mary and Karen for example are working on a book project, LCPA.
- So we have of course the LCPA 2008 and also the 2007 talks in the Garden.
- Each of the talks has its own page.
- And because talks from 2008 cover basically the same ground as the ones from 2007, there are synopses.
- With the paragraphs which have the same content side by side.
- [maybe practice guides here?]

##### How you can participate in the gardening
- If you want to see certain talks then tell me! I'm happy to adjust the pipeline of things to add.
- I'm also really keen on adding practice guides.
- Look at this one, from Padraig, for the 2020 Vajra Music series of talks.
- [click on Part 3]
- [click on Part 1 and scroll to "Condensing"]
- For me, studying the talks is an important part of my practice.
- You are invited to join me, in any way you feel like it.

### Outro
- I'd like to end this very short introduction by pointing you to the help pages.
- I've linked to a couple of videos which show the features in more breadth and depth than what is possible today in this short time.
- I'm going to put a link to the Garden in Slack.
- And if you don't feel like watching videos, I would be delighted to set up a call and share my screen or you share yours, and we stroll through the Garden together.
