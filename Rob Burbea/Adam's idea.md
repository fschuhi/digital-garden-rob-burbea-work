2nd delivery
-   idea for a 
-   sessions should be recorded and archived
-   idea for a talk: branching out into terrain visible from Rob’s teachings, e.g. “a primer on Jung”, “introduction to Islamic mysticism”, “the works of Isaac Luria” ...
-   idea: “preliminaries” (with the meaning of ngöndro), i.e. discussion of basic practice like energy body, “what I [a yogi] tried out and it worked and I’d like to tell you about it and get your feedback”
-   the pitch document for the program should be directed to Nicola
-   Nicola should be invited to contribute ***anything*** she wants, for the inaugural meeting, that should help to boost attendence
-   In your message on Slack you called for a “circle agnostic” type of meetings, i.e. yogis coming together, not circle representatives. It could be interesting, though, to get info on projects from the circles. For some people positive feedback from is important, so that could be a nice forum to get some.

3rd delivery       
- What could be a fitting name of the “regular set aside space in HAF”?
- We need a channel
	- Whatsapp Group Chat
	- Slack channel
	- Discord
	- Emails
- Why do we actually need a channel? ==should be put into the proposal==
	- drum up agenda
	- Q&A afterwards
	- assigning work
	- discussing next (set of) meetings, e.g. listen to a particular talk - - but which page, when?
- I agree that the meetings should be once per month, on Sunday evening => **get feedback from Nic**
- abstractly, each meeting has a particular setup:
	- recurring parts, or phases, or sections
		- with basically the same kind of content
			- sitting in silence
			- metta
			- seeing other as angel
			- cite sth from the pamphlet +  suggestions how to apply it
			- prayer / supplication
			- expressions of gratitude
			- yoga session
		- with different content
			- live guided meditation (yogi)
			- guided meditation (Rob)
			- group practice: pick a word (both Robology like “desire”, Dharma “karuna”, non-Buddhist “responsibility”), and freely play with it, round robin
	- non-recurring, but regular sections
		- listening to certain talks
		- collaborative reading
		- update of selected current projects from the circles
		- “structured listening” (see Vajra Music) to snippets from Rob’s talks
		- discuss specific practices from the RB canon
- adhoc sections
		- planning certain events
		- guided meditations from guests (Yahel, Suzy) => Dana
- What other “routine activities” should be included?
- Do we need a Master of Ceremonies? Who rings the bell? Different people?
- Do you find breakout sessions helpful?

  
-  ask for feedback on current personal practice challenges
-   “homework assignements”

In which way is this type of meeting (= this sangha) different from practice groups? facebook groups?

It would be a wasted opportunity to have this kind of interest and personalities and _not_ do sth like that

Should it be restricted to HAF? To Rob?

Could we think of it as HAF as organiser but inviting other groups?

Are we duplicating efforts, e.g. compared to Nathan & Zohar?

... not becoming a religion, it's not the final word

The fact that I don't know all the faces of HAF is the reason why it makes sense to have the xyz meeting.

Someone will be responsible to keep it together.

Fantasy: Everyone in HAF will engage in this format, come up with topics to fill the available space
