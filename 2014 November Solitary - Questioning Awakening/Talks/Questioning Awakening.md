```ad-quote
What I really want to explore is the assumptions underneath how we think of and conceive the Dharma, practice, the path, etc. The way we think and conceive of the Dharma, and the assumptions _underneath_ how we're thinking of and conceiving of practice, path, Dharma, are not often at the forefront of our minds. They're sort of somewhere at the back, and the assumptions are often _really_ buried.

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=07:01]]

##### We want to know something that is transcendent; understand that all is empty
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Perception]] · [[Experience]] · [[Awareness]] (2) · [[Mind]] · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=12:49]]

##### In principle, we are free to believe what we want - but are we really free to inquire?
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Dharma]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=13:28]]

```ad-quote
"Are we _really_ free?" Are we really free to inquire into the views that we hold? Or are we blinkered and blinded by assumptions that we don't even realize that we have?
```

```ad-quote
So please don't be biased by _my_ biases. If you don't agree with my bias, that's completely fine. What I really want to get to is the importance of questioning, not that I want to convince you of a certain bias I have within that range. The questioning is the important thing, okay?
```

---
##### As Buddhist, we have a common language: the Four Noble Truths, but this entails rebirth
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^3-5|3-5]]**: _[[Four Noble Truths]] (4) · [[Awareness]] · [[Pali Canon]] (2) · [[Buddha]] · [[Samsara]] · [[Rebirth]] (4) · [[Awakening]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Dukkha]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=14:48]]

```ad-quote
There's a thrust of transcendence that runs through Pali Canon teachings.
```

---
##### When we use the Four Noble Truths just as a skeleton, then this opens up a multiplicity of interpretations
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Four Noble Truths]] (6) · [[Awakening]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (5) · [[Fantasy]] · [[Dharma]] (2)_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=18:05]]

---
##### Each different focus gives samadhi a different meaning
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Zen]] · [[Samadhi]] (4) · [[Experience]] · [[Dharma]] (2) · [[Energy]] · [[Healing]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=22:59]]

```ad-quote
Even after one's so-called awakening, then what? Then what? Why are we practising? What is this path for? What is _your_ path for? Why are we here? What are we doing?
```

---
##### Differences between conceptions of awakening are hardly ever visible from the outside
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Freedom]] (5) · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Meditation]] · [[Awareness]] (3)_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=24:08]]

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=25:30]]

```ad-quote
Is there not, in the way that you feel and relate to practice, a whole kind of mythos, a whole kind of ethos, a whole particular kind of beauty that you relate to, that speaks to you, that touches your soul? Wrapped up in that, a whole way of seeing existence?
```

---
##### There is mythos wrapped up in what is important for us as the path
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Nobility]] (2) · [[Fantasy]] (5) · [[Love]] (3) · [[Consciousness]] (2) · [[Mystical opening]] · [[Perception]] (2)_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=28:36]]

<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Freedom]] (7) · [[Awakening]] (3) · [[Awareness]] · [[Meditation]] · [[Zen]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=29:32]]

```ad-quote
Is it possible that liberation, freedom, is actually ever-expanding? Could it be something ever-expanding? It realizes it's in a box, breaks the walls of that box, finds itself in another box, breaks those walls.
```

---
##### What does it mean to "live life to the full"?
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Experience]] (4)_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=30:57]]

```ad-quote
Do I dare to ask, "Why?" Why do I want to live life to the full? Why? Why do I want to savour the moment, savour the experience, the taste, the breeze on the cheek? Why?
```

---
##### That's not in the Pali Canon
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Buddha]] (4) · [[Pali Canon]] (3) · [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] · [[Mindfulness]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=32:24]]

<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Dominant Culture]] · [[Heaven]] · [[Hell]] · [[Rebirth]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=33:42]]

```ad-quote
'Life,' that word, was, in medieval Europe, experienced utterly differently. And in Asian cultures it's actually talking about a different thing.
```

---
##### What do we mean when we say "life"? Is it possible to experience it "as is"?
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Experience]] (3) · [[Buddha]] · [[Dogma]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=34:34]]

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=38:27]]

##### The film elevates also personal relationship above caring about all humans, or nature
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^8-2|8-2]]**: _[[Human Relationship]] (2) · [[Death]] · [[Nature]] · [[Dharma]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=39:24]]

##### Mindfulness as simple strategy among many, rather than a "religion"
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^8-3|8-3]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] (3) · [[Perception]] · [[Feelings]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=40:22]]

```ad-quote
If we don't separate those two, what's a simple strategy (one among many), from what's wrapped up with a whole ideology, it has a lot of consequences for the range and the power and the depth of my investigation, and for the range and power and depth of experiences that open up for me.
```

---
##### Is simple mindfulness rich enough as a philosophy or as a psychology?
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^8-4|8-4]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (5) · [[Soul]] (2) · [[Psyche]] · [[Eros]] · [[Passion]]_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] (3) · [[Impermanence]] · [[Death]] · [[Meditation]] · [[Insight]] · [[The Self]]_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=43:20]]

```ad-quote
Rather than seeing meditation and mindfulness, then, as being part of a thrust of understanding reality, seeing a deeper level of reality, in this case reality is given with common sense.
```

---
##### Example: realizing eternal awareness vs it's just your brain doing weird stuff
<span class="counts">**[[1112 Questioning Awakening#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[Meditation]] (5) · [[Awareness]] (2)_</span>

![[20141112-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-questioning_awakening-26010.mp3#t=46:08]]

```ad-quote
It's impossible to get away from that. You can _think_ you're away from it, you can _assume_ you're away from it. It's impossible to get away from ontology, epistemology,cosmology - metaphysics. And always we have to assume something. There is always an assumption that ends up being actually unprovable - always.

```ad-quote
Axiomatic: there's nothing beyond this. What do you mean by _this_? What do you mean? Poke, question. What do you mean by _this_? Do you mean matter? Or do you mean appearances? Big difference in what is meant. If you mean matter, what is it that you mean by matter? {quote If you mean appearances, there's nothing beyond appearances, again, what exactly do you mean? And do you understand, through meditation, the dependent arising and the dependent fading and cessation of all appearances, so that there can be a beyond this, a beyond appearances? This is available in meditation.

And the therapist saying, "You've got to hang in there. It's a dark night. You can't run away from it. It's the truth coming up." Or is it the fact that psychological ideas, certain psychological ideas, are stimulating certain experiences? That the experience, rather than being real or true, is actually _caused_ by certain ideas?

##### Unquestioned ideas operate in us, and they will keep delivering the same limited range of experiences, unless they are questioned

Carl Jung said, "Ideas are not made by persons, but persons by ideas." We don't see how powerful ideas are, because they shape the way we see ourselves and the world and existence, and then that's the existence that we feel ourselves move in. They conjure our experience.

```ad-quote
Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the perception, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my feelings, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned ways of looking, unquestioned conceptual framework, etc., unquestioned metaphysics, really. We somehow need to question and to put in new ideas. Somehow.
