<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-1|1-1]]**: _[[Compassion]] (3)_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=00:25]]

```ad-quote
compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative self-view.
```

---
##### It wants to alleviate the suffering
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-3|1-3]]**: _[[Compassion]] (3) · [[Energy]] · [[Dukkha]] (4) · [[Insight]] · [[Metta]] (3)_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=01:20]]

```ad-quote
when the stream of loving-kindness, the stream of _mettā -_ if it's running, when it meets suffering, it turns organically and very naturally into compassion.
```

---
##### Compassion has many aspects to it
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Compassion]] (3) · [[Dharma]]_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=02:18]]

---
##### It includes empathy, and giving
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Compassion]] (3) · [[Empathy]] · [[Meditation]]_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=02:47]]

---
##### Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity, and wisdom
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-6|1-6]]**: _[[Compassion]] (7) · [[Equanimity]] · [[Steadiness]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (4) · [[Insight]] (6) · [[Freedom]]_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=03:14]]

```ad-quote
But compassion as such is not blind. Compassion has in it some degree of understanding of what the causes of suffering are, and in it, a willingness and a wish to uncover the causes of suffering, at as deep a level as possible.
```

---
##### Compassion has kindness in it, and acceptance, and listening, and a quality of opening, and happiness, and faith
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^1-7|1-7]]**: _[[Compassion]] (10) · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Acceptance]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Energy]] · [[Happiness]] (2) · [[Devotion]] (2)_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=04:27]]

```ad-quote
Listening is very much a quality of compassion. Sometimes we encounter someone, we're with someone - there's nothing we can do for their situation except listen, except open ourselves in that way. And that's compassion. When in a way one's giving the listening, although it's a kind of receiving, one's giving that, offering that.
```

---
##### Like metta, compassion is not just a feeling
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[Metta]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (3) · [[Healing]] · [[Energy]] · [[Feelings]] · [[Impermanence]]_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=05:36]]

```ad-quote
And if in our life our compassion is restricted to when we _feel_ it, that's too limited. Sometimes in our life we _don't_ feel it, but we act still. We _do_, we _act_ with compassion. We embody that intention. We cannot feel it all the time because feelings are impermanent
```

---
##### It's easy to see compassion as a kind of burden
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[Compassion]] (4) · [[Dukkha]] (2)_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=06:20]]

---
##### We fear that compassion will overwhelm us
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Fear]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (4) · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (4)_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=08:23]]

```ad-quote
I think a part of us realizes that through compassion and in compassion, there's a very deep connection going on. There's a very deep _reconnection_ going on. We are reconnecting to ourselves, some very deep aspect of ourselves, of our being, of our heart.
```

---
##### Energizing rather tiring, pleasant rather than unpleasant
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^2-5|2-5]]**: _[[Compassion]] (5) · [[Energy]] · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Pleasantness]]_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=09:44]]

```ad-quote
Even though we're opening ourselves to suffering, we're tuning into suffering, we're looking at it, we're willing to let the heart resonate with it - still, compassion is a pleasant quality. It's a pleasant abiding, a sublime or divine abiding.
```

---

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=22:43]]

```ad-quote
The more we let go of self, the looser - rather, the more we loosen our identification, the more compassion is allowed into the being. It's like literally there is more space in the heart when we're less constricting around self-definition, self-views, ownership, identification.
```

##### Action, i.e. putting ourselves in situations of service
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Compassion]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Dharma]]_</span>

```ad-quote
So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well. The actions in our life will flow back into the heart and the consciousness when we come back to sit. Most things in Dharma work both ways in terms of causality.
```

```ad-quote
And there are plenty of bodhisattvas in this world, living out a life of compassion, both in the first world and the second world and the third world and - all of it. And one can seek out these people and be around them. There are a lot of remarkable beings out there. And just to let that rub off. Let something of their compassion, but also, in a way, their _abandon,_ because there's freedom in compassion.
```

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=29:42]]

```ad-quote
And the presence of the fear actually tends to either make us feel overwhelmed, which is what we were fearing anyway, and/or increases our sense of suffering when we are open to the suffering of others. So the fear is exactly doing what we're afraid we would feel anyway.
```

##### (2) (Righteous) Anger
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Anger]] (4) · [[Dukkha]] (5) · [[Compassion]] (4)_</span>

![[20080204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion-11950.mp3#t=35:49]]

```ad-quote
Cultivating, developing, reinforcing - remember these habit pattern things we keep talking about. You get a record in a groove. And we're saying, with the _mettā_ and compassion, you can change that groove.
```

```ad-quote
how much deep happiness is available for someone cultivating those qualities of heart, cultivating greed long-term? How much deep happiness is available to them? Cultivating insensitivity long-term - so, sure, they might have the riches, and they might have this and that. But in the heart, how much deep happiness is available? They're actually - when _any_ of us acts that way in the world, we're closing the doors for the possibility of deep happiness.

```ad-quote
Give the compassion to the self, and the being, the heart, can soften and open. And then perhaps the compassion can flow. When we're caught up in anger, we are hurting. When we're caught up in blame and judgment, we are hurting. Sometimes we don't realize it. So, compassion to the self.
```

---
##### Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Anger]] · [[Near enemy]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Dukkha]] (3) · [[Aversion]] (2) · [[Healing]] (2) · [[Insight]] (2)_</span>

```ad-quote
It embraces suffering, holds it, accommodates it, and then adds healing, and adds understanding. So it's not an aversive movement; it's a holding, and a bringing in of healing and understanding.
```

##### (3) Pity

Compassion empowers; pity disempowers.

So compassion to self and other is empowering, not debilitating.

```ad-quote
So instead of looking at the differences - "I don't really do that. I don't suffer like that," how easily that can come in - remind oneself of what's common, the common humanity in that moment.

##### (4) Grief
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Compassion (talk)#^9-4|9-4]]**: _[[Fear]] · [[Anger]] · [[Pity]] · [[Grief]] (8) · [[Dukkha]] · [[Near enemy]] · [[Energy]] · [[Healing]] · [[Tiredness]]_</span>

```ad-quote
When there's grief around, if it's grief, it will be tiring. That tiring, that tiredness, it kind of makes the being, makes the heart, more vulnerable to more grief, which makes the heart _more_ tired. And it spirals on itself that way.
```

```ad-quote
Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out.

```ad-quote
a little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the happiness makes compassion enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing. And we need to kind of feel that energy in the body, that energy going, or even just imagine it.

It's as if the sense of the heart expands and _can_ expand so that it feels almost like it fills the space, or as if the suffering in the world is being held by a compassion that, in a way, is part of the fabric of the universe. It's a kind of universal compassion.

```ad-quote
the suffering in the world is _held -_ held, we could say, in the love of the universe, in the compassion of the universe, in the heart of God, whatever language works. It's almost like something deepens, and the true nature of the heart is seen as not limited, but actually infinite and vast.

##### Reflect on that my suffering is actually not different from the suffering of others

"It's just me that has this. I'm the one that goes through this. No one else has this." Sometimes it's not even a conscious thought, and we're adding, we're stacking on the suffering by this isolating of ourselves.

##### In the realization of the humanity, there's a kind of softening

```ad-quote
Instead of being rigidly, brittlely wrapped up in a kind of self-isolation, a self-definition and separateness, just dropping in the reflection of that commonness, that sharedness, the humanity, allows it to soften. And in the softening, there's an opening, and the compassion can begin to flow.

this body is coming - the elements in it come from elements that were generated in massive stars, and then those stars exploded and flung out these elements into space. And all the elements that make up our fingernails and our cornea and whatever it is - everyone in this room, the elements that made that were born in the same star. I think it's amazing!
