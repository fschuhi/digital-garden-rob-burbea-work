```ad-quote
And this is partly why we keep encouraging this sensitivity that's developed in your practice, particularly sensitivity to the body, and just actually _allowing_ the _mettā_ to take these subtly different flavours, at times. Sometimes, when it has that feeling, to go through that, and really just allowing that.

```ad-quote
So _mettā_ in its aspiration is: it doesn't matter what you do, what you give me back, what you say, whether you're grateful, what you've done, whether I like you - none of that. It's unconditional. But usually, there are strings and conditions attached to our love, and it's actually attached love.

It means to care about that, and to try and keep breaking that open, and having it be fresh. And that's quite a task. I think it's quite a task.

The question, Dharmically, is not that that shouldn't be there, that we shouldn't have a sense of our individuality and our uniqueness.

And there's a way that the self and the very individuality and uniqueness of the self is inextricably bound up with, actually, _everything else_ in the whole universe. We have a delusion of separateness.
```
