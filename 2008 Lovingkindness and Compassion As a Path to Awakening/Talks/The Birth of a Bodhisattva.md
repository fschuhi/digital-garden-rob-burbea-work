![[20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=10:14]]

```ad-quote
when we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing.
```

---
##### Develop the skill to find the dynamic balance
<span class="counts">**[[0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Empathy]] · [[Grief]] (3) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Dukkha]] (2)_</span>

```ad-quote
And it's a beautiful, precious treasure of what it is to be human, to live in the fullness of our humanity, that we _will_ feel that, and we _will_ shed tears, and we _will_ feel that grief.
```

<span class="counts">**[[0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^4-7|4-7]]**: _[[Samadhi]] (4) · [[Retreat]] (2) · [[Happiness]] (7) · [[Mudita]] · [[Equanimity]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] (2)_</span>

![[20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=16:06]]

```ad-quote
When we have joy, when we're familiar and have familiar access with a sense of joy in our life, we have enough. And then we're less shakeable in this life and in relationship to our suffering and the suffering of others.
```

##### The whole range of feeling compassion is important

```ad-quote
In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that spaciousness, where whatever suffering there is or whatever suffering could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that experience and then actually nurture it.
```

##### This can be very beautiful, even mystical

![[20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=28:02]]

```ad-quote
Sometimes we're _too_ cautious perhaps. And perhaps there _is_ a place for stretching ourselves, stretching our limits, just saying, "To hell with myself and my self-concern," and just a kind of abandon. Maybe that has its place. Or rather, it definitely has its place, but it needs to be approached with wisdom. And stretching the limits of one's stamina and one's endurance in serving and in giving - there is the place for that.
```

```ad-quote
Either the body's niggling, or something's not right. It can be very skilful to just drop in, "It doesn't matter how I feel right now. It doesn't matter. I'm just giving the compassion to you." You can just play with this kind of abandonment of self-concern - not all the time, but just sometimes.
```

##### It can happen that we feel that our needs are not being met

```ad-quote
'co-dependency.' It's actually a mutual investment in someone suffering and the other person kind of wanting to keep them down.

```ad-quote
So when I say 'strength,' I really mean to stay open, that the heart stays open, and stays soft and tender.

```ad-quote
To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the suffering, and it's only one strand in a web of conditions.
```

---
##### Example: giving a talk
<span class="counts">**[[0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Energy]] · [[Dependent Origination]] (2)_</span>

![[20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=39:05]]

##### The talk is landing in a lot of different mind states
<span class="counts">**[[0212 The Birth of a Bodhisattva#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[The Self]] · [[Mind state]] · [[Retreat]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Insight]] · [[Compassion]] (2)_</span>

![[20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=40:36]]

```ad-quote
So a talk, or a Dharma teaching, or whatever it is, an insight, is actually just a seed. And then it needs to meet a lot of other conditions.
```

##### The talk is just a seed

```ad-quote
Beings that we are helping, we need to remember, after this interaction, after this giving of the compassion, they go on, and they meet, they will meet, other conditions and other influences. I am not the sole provider of conditions and compassion.

![[20080212-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_birth_of_a_bodhisattva-11954.mp3#t=42:39]]

```ad-quote
When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed.

Moving away from the kind of sense of consolation one gets from God or bodhisattva or whatever it is, away from that to _thy will_, and actually into the dark night of the soul, where one feels one isn't getting anything. There's something in that darkness, in that not getting.

_I_ feel pretty sure that Father Kolbe was seeing that situation differently. There was something in the depth of his faith and devotion and sense of, in this case, sense of God, or whatever you want to call it, something that allowed him to see that situation differently, so that the suffering is not the whole of reality. This is very interesting. Or that suffering is not as real as it seems. Or that the suffering, again, is held in something else. It's held in something else. All of these are different views of suffering. They're different ways that the suffering is seen and related to.

there's a faith in it - faith in that, and also faith that it's possible for me. It's possible for me to cultivate - wherever I am now, whatever lack of beautiful qualities I seem to have when I look inside, however impoverished I feel - it's possible for me, it's possible for this being, this heart, this mind, to cultivate beautiful qualities and grow, let them grow.

```ad-quote
That's what wisdom or insight or _paññā_ means: we're understanding the causes and conditions that lead to suffering. And out of that very understanding is born compassion. That very understanding will bring with it compassion. So one could never go anywhere near loving-kindness practice or compassion practice, and just the deepening of the insight will bring compassion naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the causes and conditions and _understanding_ that.

living with love and compassion is the best way to live. It's the best way. So we can say, "What's the point? It doesn't make any difference. It's not going to make any difference." It's the best way to live, even when we're very conscious of the limits and the seeming pointlessness of it, out there.

There are many ways of seeing emptiness. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops.
```

```ad-quote
And just to remember that emptiness is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for freedom from suffering, for the release from suffering. So compassion is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow.

##### Story: 9/11 was not "nothing happened"

```ad-quote
Now, ultimately speaking, you _could_ say nothing happened that day. Nothing happened _really_. But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our understanding of emptiness is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates compassion, then you put down the emptiness as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of compassion, and you relate in terms of beings suffering and my response to their suffering.

It's all empty. At one level, nothing happened. At another level, I'm right there. That's what allows a bodhisattva to be a bodhisattva, is that the emptiness and the compassion are together. Without that, forget about it.
