Just opening up the awareness to the huge stream of generosity, of care that we have received from our parents. Allowing the heart to open, too, to their pain, their suffering, their confusion. Wherever they are now, "May they be free from suffering. May they be at peace."

```ad-quote
Holding it all in compassion. Allowing it to be held in compassion. Realizing, reflecting: nothing, absolutely nothing is outside this web, this infinite web. Sustaining us, nourishing us, giving to us. And that we too are part of that web. Sensitive to suffering. Letting it be held in compassion. And just allowing a sense of space to open up. And allowing the body to just radiate out compassion in space, filling space, all space, all directions. Filling it with that tenderness, with that healing. Holding all things in compassion.

```ad-quote
If the _samādhi_ feels strong enough or there's a sense of settledness in the mind and the heart with the compassion, it can be almost, at times, as if the body has _turned into_ compassion. And you just let yourself _be_ compassion, and just radiate that out. Let everything become compassion.
