### Review
##### Cultivating loving-kindness and compassion brings blessings for self and for other
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-1|1-1]]**: _[[Love]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Metta]] (3) · [[Compassion]] · [[Blessing]] (2) · [[Retreat]] · [[Cultivation]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=00:00]]

---
##### Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-2|1-2]]**: _[[Reconditioning]] (2) · [[Mind]] · [[Habit]] · [[Buddha]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=01:14]]

```ad-quote
we're reconditioning the heart and the mind, which essentially, you could say, is a whirlpool, a web of conditioning, of conditions and habits of conditions.
```

```ad-quote
"Drop by drop the bucket is filled."
```

---
##### We are nurturing the best possible climate for our growth
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-3|1-3]]**: _[[Metta]] (3) · [[Compassion]] (2) · [[Insight]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=02:17]]

```ad-quote
through cultivating loving-kindness and compassion, we're also nurturing and establishing the best possible climate for our growth: so psychological, emotional, spiritual growth.
```

---
##### Two wings for the path: wholesome nourishment and investigation for insight
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Buddha]] · [[Dharma]] (2) · [[Meditation]] · [[Kusala]] (5) · [[Cultivation]] (5) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Mind]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Generosity]] · [[Equanimity]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Insight]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=03:26]]

---
##### Wholesome nourishment through metta and samadhi
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Metta]] · [[Kusala]] (2) · [[Cultivation]] (2) · [[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Awareness]] · [[Retreat]] · [[Experience]] · [[Love]] · [[Compassion]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=04:54]]

---
##### Questioning
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[Compassion]] · [[Pity]] · [[Feelings]] (3)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=06:06]]

```ad-quote
So there's the questioning. There is allowing ourselves to feel what needs to be felt at times, feeling the feelings.
```

---
##### Encouragement
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Feelings]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=06:53]]

```ad-quote
Sometimes we're more questioning, sometimes we're more allowing what needs to bubble up, and sometimes we're just developing the _samādhi_ and letting things get quiet, developing that journey into the depth, into the stillness, into the subtlety.
```

---
##### Samadhi is one of the factors that allows the love and compassion to come into the cells
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Samadhi]] (3) · [[Meditation]] · [[Insight]] · [[Love]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Habit]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=07:35]]

---
##### Cultivation is not about self-improvement
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Kusala]] (2) · [[Cultivation]] (5) · [[Insight]] · [[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (2) · [[Mind]] (2) · [[Reconditioning]] · [[Anatta]] (2) · [[Centre]] (2)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=08:41]]

```ad-quote
So it's really not about self-improvement, and the whole notion of a self to improve begins to just loosen in time with practice. And yet, we can still be really committed to this process of cultivation, of developing the nourishment, of reconditioning.
```

---
##### "Reconditioning" might be a dry word, but it's an important part of what's going on
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^2-5|2-5]]**: _[[Reconditioning]] · [[Retreat]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Mind]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Dharma]]_</span>

##### Recondition (i.e. working on a relative level) brings well-being and sets up conditions that lead to the Unconditioned

##### In the Mahayana traditions, "compassion" includes loving-kindness
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^4-8|4-8]]**: _[[Compassion]] (5) · [[Love]] (2) · [[Mahayana]] · [[Metta]] (2)_</span>

##### "Dharmas" here mean things in experience, i.e. objects of awareness
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^4-9|4-9]]**: _[[Dharma]] (3) · [[Love]] · [[Awareness]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Mind state]] · [[Samadhi]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^4-10|4-10]]**: _[[Awareness]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

##### Recap guided meditation: directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Meditation]] · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (4) · [[Experience]] (3) · [[Love]] (2) · [[Awareness]] · [[Consciousness]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=19:20]]

```ad-quote
We can, in our practice, direct this stream, at times, when we feel a stream of loving-kindness and compassion, actually direct it towards experience, whatever the experience is, and actually bathe that experience in loving-kindness and compassion, _or_ compassion, or both, or a mixture, or whatever it is. We can _hold_ it in compassion, _hold_ it in love, or _let_ it be held in that water of love.

##### Emphasizing acceptance, not so much precision and clarity
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Love]] (3) · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (2) · [[Acceptance]] (3) · [[Mindfulness]] (3) · [[Experience]] (2)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=20:29]]

```ad-quote
One works in the practice to make it completely genuine, really, really welcoming this experience so that the arising of any experience is completely welcomed, completely held in that love.
```

---
##### Arising, staying, passing - held in love, or direct that intentionality
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^5-6|5-6]]**: _[[Experience]] · [[Phenomenon]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Love]] (2) · [[Metta]] (2)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=22:17]]

---
##### Whatever is going on, the attitude of acceptence can always just expand a little and include whatever it is
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^5-7|5-7]]**: _[[Acceptance]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=23:18]]

```ad-quote
Nothing is outside it. Whatever's going on can actually be welcomed and included.
```

##### Phenomena are fleeting by their nature, so they are deserving of compassion
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Experience]] · [[Phenomenon]] · [[Nature]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Feelings]] (2) · [[Love]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=24:03]]

```ad-quote
Everything is so fleeting. And so things, phenomena, _dharmas_ are fleeting by their nature, when we look at them. And in a way, you could say, they're deserving of compassion. They're impoverished. They barely last.
```

---
##### The experiences begin to lose their edges, fade, dissolve
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Feelings]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Perception]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Phenomenon]] · [[Experience]] · [[Emptiness]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=25:31]]

---
##### The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation, but well-being and investigation
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^6-5|6-5]]**: _[[Meditation]] (3) · [[Buddha]] · [[Kusala]] (2) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Pleasantness]] (2)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=26:56]]

```ad-quote
what he taught much more is this wholesome nourishment, wholesome developing of what's beautiful, and the well-being that that provides, and the _well_ of well-being that that provides_, and_ investigation. It's not that he taught a particular technique or you have to do this or that. It's those two together that were taught.
```

---
##### The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^6-6|6-6]]**: _[[Kusala]] (2) · [[Cultivation]] (2) · [[Pleasantness]] · [[Freedom]] (4) · [[Image]] · [[Buddha]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=27:46]]

```ad-quote
The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does.
```

---
##### In mindfulness practice, the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] (6) · [[Dharma]] (6) · [[Letting go]] (2) · [[Insight]] (2) · [[Freedom]] (2)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=28:33]]

```ad-quote
And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions.
```

##### Example: angers colours the perception, and so does metta
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Nature]] · [[Perception]] (5) · [[Experience]] · [[Anger]] (2) · [[Retreat]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Beauty]]_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=30:46]]

```ad-quote
anger _colours_ the perception at times. And we even have a phrase in English: one is 'seeing red.' I was seeing red, or he's seeing red; she's seeing red. The very words are implying this colouring of perception. One's looking at the world, at the situation in that moment, through the lenses of anger. And the perception is correspondingly changed - of a person, of ourselves, of a situation.
```

---
##### With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself, perception softens
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Love]] · [[Perception]] (4) · [[Anger]] (2) · [[Retreat]] · [[Metta]] (7) · [[Mind]] (3)_</span>

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=32:11]]

```ad-quote
The mind, the heart begins to soften because one's meeting oneself with _mettā - can_ do. Things soften, the mind softens, the _eyes_ then soften, and the _perception_ softens, because perception is dependent on the state of the mind.
```

---
##### There is always some degree of love or aversion in the mind
<span class="counts">**[[0210 Love and the Emptiness of Things#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Love]] (4) · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Mind]] (2) · [[Anger]] · [[Aversion]] (2) · [[Mindfulness]] (2) · [[Consciousness]] · [[Craving]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

##### The presence of love and equanimity makes objects less prominent in consciousness

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=36:41]]

##### Also off cushion, when there's a lot of love or equanimity, problems barely impact

![[20080210-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_the_emptiness_of_things-11953.mp3#t=41:30]]

```ad-quote
The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it. To the degree that love comes into that relationship, that peace comes into that relationship, the suffering goes out of experience.
```

```ad-quote
The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any experience is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of insight. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to consciousness.
```

##### Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking

```ad-quote
Vast sense of oneness - beautiful. Beautiful for consciousness to open up to, at times. But even that is actually empty. It's still a perception that's come into being through the way we are looking, through our relationship _with_.

By not holding to fixed views - of how things are, how I am, how an object is, how the world is. By not holding to fixed views - that's where this is going. That's the piece. That's the hinge pin.

To say things don't exist is clearly not true. But to see that they don't exist in any way independently from the way I am looking, independently from the relationship with. So when it says they don't exist, it means they don't exist independently, inherently. Or as the Tibetans say, they don't exist 'from their own side.'

the more welcoming there is, basically the less aversion, the less pushing away and pulling towards (we say "less pushing and pulling"; that's less grasping), and what we notice is that the world, the world of experience, appears less. And if there's really very little grasping, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about grasping that's actually building experience. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that.

When anything comes up - whatever it is, anxiety or anything at all - there's conditioning from the past. As you say, this comes from the past. But that past conditioning is _not enough_ for it to arise in the present. A thing cannot arise in the present without me doing something as well in the present. And you _can't_ change the past, so to speak, but what we can do is understand, "What is it that I'm putting _in_ in the present which is sustaining or even allowing this thing to arise?"
