If the fear's not that strong, it's possible - just take a step back, say, "I've got two things going on," not push away the fear, but just incline towards what's pleasurable, what's enjoyable in the experience, and just lean that way. And the very enjoying of it will help the fear to just subside.

We tend to think of a storehouse of old emotions: "Here's anger. I need to release it. I need it to come up." But it cannot come up unless the conditions in the present moment are there for it to come up. And sometimes when we're really clear, we can actually see this process, that if we don't feed it in the present, it doesn't come up. It _cannot_ come up.

And I think 'willingness' is a really important word - willing to try everything, even when we feel like, "I don't really want to try that end of things,"
```

```ad-quote
It's not the case that one thing is always going to work. It's just not. One day, one hour, one approach will work. The next hour, the very opposite. So it's more in this willingness to experiment, and willingness to sometimes do what you don't feel like doing, and sometimes it's very much the opposite.
```

```ad-quote
I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the spaciousness, the letting go, is very significant. You can be letting go of a lot of aversion in that. Aversion has a lot to do with tiredness. When there's aversion around, it's just very tiring. So letting go, being spacious, actually allows that to just let go.
