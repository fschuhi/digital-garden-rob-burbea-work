### Why it is important to give compassion to myself
##### Today we add the compassion to the self

##### This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with
<span class="counts">**[[0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Ways of looking]] · [[Compassion]] (3) · [[The Self]] · [[Dukkha]] (5) · [[Insight]] (3)_</span>

```ad-quote
So because we're most intimate with this psychophysical organism, that's where we learn the most. And that wisdom then translates and transfers into compassion for others, because we understand the roots of suffering. The more we understand the roots of suffering, the more compassion there can be for all beings.

### Techniques
##### Different from insight practice, in compassion practice one is more interest in what is around the pain, not in the center of it
<span class="counts">**[[0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^2-10|2-10]]**: _[[Compassion]] (2) · [[Insight]] · [[Pain]] (6) · [[Meditation]] · [[Centre]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] · [[Attention]]_</span>

![[20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=07:05]]

```ad-quote
But in a way, one's more interested in what's _around_ that, in the - someone in their note, beautifully put - the _holding_ that goes _around_ the pain. So it's as if this pain is at the centre. And we're not denying it. We're still feeling it, but we're not going right into it. We're more interested in the warmth and the tenderness and the holding that's around it.
```

##### Compassion to self does not build the ego

![[20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=08:36]]

```ad-quote
A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious.
```

##### Compassion is a lighter energy than metta, so phrases can be used more lightly
<span class="counts">**[[0205 Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Love]] · [[Cultivation]] · [[The Self]] · [[Compassion]] (4) · [[Energy]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] · [[Empathy]]_</span>

![[20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=10:02]]

```ad-quote
Some people just use the phrases much more lightly, and this allows the sense of drawing close to the suffering, of empathy, and also of giving. So play with that. Play with how heavily and tightly you hold the phrases.
```

![[20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=12:34]]

```ad-quote
One sees what one's doing, what one's clinging to right there and then, and it just can unhook it - because there's this attunement to suffering, because of the compassion practice.
```

---
##### Somehow in the seeing and the softness, it just unhooks

![[20080205-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-compassion_part_two_compassion_for_ourselves-11949.mp3#t=15:20]]

```ad-quote
Not a self - I don't ever encounter a self. What I encounter is moments of mind with something happening in that mind moment, moments of awareness.
```

```ad-quote
And the paradox is there: the less the receiver of compassion, and the less the giver of compassion, the more compassion there is. How odd!
```
