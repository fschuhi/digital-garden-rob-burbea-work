is it even possible to create a large form (say a long piece of music, or a novel, or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time) without craving, clinging, attachment, desire? Or training - the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity

##### For some people, a couple of Dharma concepts are adequate, for others definitely not
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Dharma]]_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=10:23]]

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=11:16]]

```ad-quote
There's a constrainment of the idea of what's allowed in terms of desire, and also of fantasy and image of what awakening looks like, what kind of desires and involvements an awakened person has, and therefore what we're moving towards.
```

---
##### Fantasy of the Buddhist path
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Fantasy]] (8) · [[Activism]] (2) · [[Dharma]] (4) · [[Zen]] (2) · [[Mahayana]] · [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] · [[Sangha]] · [[Dukkha]] · [[Freedom]] · [[Awakening]] · [[Bodhisattva]]_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=13:08]]

---
##### "This is what a bodhisattva does"
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Allen Ginsberg]] · [[Chogyam Trungpa]] · [[Bodhisattva]] · [[Fantasy]] (3) · [[Dharma]] · [[Awakening]]_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=14:53]]

---
##### The problem is when fantasy is regarded as a problem
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Fantasy]] (10) · [[Letting go]] (3) · [[Conceptual Framework]] · [[Image]] (4) · [[Hermit]] · [[Love]]_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=15:38]]

```ad-quote
There is the necessity of fantasy, the inevitability of fantasy when we care deeply, when we love, when we're attracted. The problem is when the fantasy is unconscious or regarded as a problem.
```

---
##### Sometimes our fantasies about the Dharma are inadquate, e.g. what it says about romantic love
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Fantasy]] (4) · [[Psyche]] · [[Dharma]] (2) · [[Metta]] (5) · [[Romantic love]] (4) · [[Desire]] · [[Kalyanamittata]] (2) · [[Spiritual friendship]] (4) · [[Clinging]]_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=17:13]]

---
##### When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about, the whole structure will snap
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Conceptual Framework]] (2) · [[Fantasy]] · [[Romantic love]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Cultivation]]_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=19:25]]

```ad-quote
Can I have a conceptual framework, can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a fantasy that, actually, romantic love becomes part of the path, and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot nourish those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them.
```

##### 3 distinctions, divisions, directions (for "clinging")

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=21:54]]

```ad-quote
_avijjā_ is clinging, this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the way of looking. It's a clinging. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that clinging of delusion up and down on a spectrum, and see what happens.
```

---
##### 3. movement of eros (soulmaking)

```ad-quote
What is the purpose? And what is the range of possibility of each, of what can be opened up and revealed and given to us, if you like, through each investigation?
```

---
##### Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=25:41]]

```ad-quote
neither that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros.
```

---
##### Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues
<span class="counts">**[[0117 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Soul]] · [[Passion]] · [[Desire]] · [[Eros]] · [[Dependent Origination]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Mind]] (3) · [[Craving]] (4) · [[Letting go]] (2) · [[Awakening]] (2)_</span>

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=27:14]]

```ad-quote
And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that.
```

---
##### Is there something missing in the way we categorize our desires and what we seek from them?

![[20170117-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_3-40192.mp3#t=33:58]]

```ad-quote
We want _more_ than ease and peace - certainly, probably certainly, than either the kind of ease and peace that is just a matter of stress reduction, or coping with pain, painful sensations. Even we want more than the ease and peace of the most profound kind, the most comprehensive kind. So look. See. Even within the Dharma, isn't it more than ease you want? Isn't it more than _that_ that you're looking for? Yes, there's ease. There's the ease of suffering that we're after. And what? If you love the Dharma, it's not just that.

the mode of mind, the gear, the circuitry, if you like, should revert to a kind of more mindful stance, a kind of neutral gear, which will be more easeful of the suffering that's inherent in discrepancy-based processing.

```ad-quote
they can't postpone the soul-calling to include an exploration of eros fully, richly, deeply on the path. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of delusion, the impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer. So be it.

```ad-quote
there are some who can't wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different ways of looking, different practices, trial and error (with the help, hopefully, of the teachers), but to discern between these different movements: what's _papañca_? What's imaginal practice? It's possible. It's absolutely possible. But in a way, parallel tracks are running concurrently.
