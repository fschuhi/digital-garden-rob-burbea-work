```ad-quote
eros involves and leads to soulmaking, and widening of the senses of sacredness beyond just the 'is-ness' of things, and even beyond the transcendence that's possible for us, for consciousness, transcendence in oneness or the Unfabricated. And opening up sacredness wider than a kind of universal sacredness.
```

---
##### This delineation of eros is based on a phenomenological approach
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Eros]] (2) · [[Conceptual Framework]] (3) · [[Retreat]] · [[Phenomenology]] (2) · [[Experience]] (3) · [[Insight]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Imaginal]] · [[Soulmaking]]_</span>

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=04:05]]

```ad-quote
Phenomenological observation is always informed by a conceptual framework. But the definitions we're using are based on, really, what is observed in experience in that territory.
```

---
##### Hermeneutical circle
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Delineations]] · [[Hermeneutics#Overview]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Tantra]] · [[Eros]]_</span>

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=05:37]]

```ad-quote
So this word that I want to interpret in the text, the word is part of a much larger group of words that make up the text, and the text itself is part of a much larger, probably, group of texts, or stream of tradition, or historical context or whatever. And I can't fully understand the part unless I understand the whole.
```

##### The conundrum of the hermeneutic circle, using the example of understanding mindfulness as part of the Dharma

---
##### Eros is tied in with other notions, concepts, and experiences
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[Dharma]] · [[Eros]] (4) · [[Retreat]] · [[Insight]]_</span>

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=08:49]]

```ad-quote
because of this contextualization and relationship, and the place that something like eros takes within a larger set and framework of ideas and experiences, etc., it means that we're going to have to move back and forth between a sort of small vision, big vision, and tie things together.
```

---
##### Eros, like the (demi-)god, is not fully capturable in concept
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Eros]] (3) · [[Divinity]] (2) · [[Conceptual Framework]] (4)_</span>

```ad-quote
(A) we can't avoid conceptuality, and (B), actually conceptuality is necessary and part of the erotic movement. This is the thing: an expanding, not a limited or fixed or stuck conceptuality; that's where the rub comes.
```

---

```ad-quote
'Erotic object' means what eros is in relationship to, or the 'beloved,' if you like, if you want that more poetic language.
```

---
##### Eros is a wanting to penetrate the erotic object more

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=14:55]]

```ad-quote
eros is the wanting of more contact, more connection, more touch, more knowing, more experience of, to experience more of, to have more intimacy, more penetration, more opening to the erotic object or beloved.
```

```ad-quote
Eros always goes along with - I think he's another god called Pothos. Pothos is another Greek word. And Pothos is the infinite desire or the desire for the infinite. It's the 'more.'
```

---
##### The definition may sound a bit dull, but it allows for richness and multidirectionality
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Beauty]] (2) · [[Eros]] (2)_</span>

##### Eros is not limited to sexuality (see above), nor does it equal life force

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=10:38]]

```ad-quote
I would say eros is a part or an element of life force, or, better, a certain direction or manifestation of life force. As beings, we have a certain amount of life force at any time, or just in our existence, and eros would be one directionality and one manifestation of the way that life force manifests.
```

---
##### Eros is also defined here as movement towards oneness

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=20:29]]

---
##### Eros does not move towards dissolution, i.e. it will either resurrect a twoness after unification, or discover more otherness
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[Eros]] (2) · [[Desire]] · [[Experience]] · [[Oneness]] (3) · [[The Self]]_</span>

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=21:59]]

```ad-quote
It will resist somehow that collapse to oneness. It will preserve the twoness, the self and the erotic other, the erotic object, the beloved.
```

##### We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind
<span class="counts">**[[0119 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Dharma]] · [[Awareness]] · [[Mind state]] (2) · [[Passion]] · [[Eros]] · [[Energy Body]] (2) · [[Mind]] (3)_</span>

![[20170119-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_2-40164.mp3#t=25:14]]

```ad-quote
as practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our awareness to be able to notice mind states. If we're calling eros a mind state or a state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the energy body is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of mind, and what we might call the space of mind, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they're underneath or alongside thought.
```

##### Like everything, eros is happening on a spectrum

```ad-quote
There's an element in eros, if you like, that preserves the otherness, and therefore the tension of the two and the tension of the attraction.

```ad-quote
Eros always invokes, is involved with or involves, and stimulates the imaginal and the soulmaking. I'll explain more about this later. That process of soulmaking and the imaginal is, in itself, rich, and so eros brings more richness.
```

---
##### We are attracted to the dynamic complex of image, idea, and eros itself

```ad-quote
There's an arousal of interest. We're really interested in this beloved. Something engages us, compelling in the best sense of the word. It's really captivating, again in the best sense of the word. The interest is aroused. And also the energy body is aroused, by which I mean the energy body is energized. It will feel energized, it will feel open, and it will probably feel aligned.

```ad-quote
'bliss' as an experience of the energy body, of great pleasantness in the energy body, of rapture or joy in the energy body, and that kind of openness, etc., sometimes very intense, sometimes much more subtle. {quote But that energy body experience of bliss, I would say, accompanies _any_ lightening or unfabricating, to whatever degree, of the self-sense, up to a certain point, at least.
