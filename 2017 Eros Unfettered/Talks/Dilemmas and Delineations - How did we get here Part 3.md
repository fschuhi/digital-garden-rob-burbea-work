Interesting footnote, added to the [[0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#4-1]]

> Editor's note: please see the [[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Hermeneutical circle|beginning of Part 2 of this talk]]  for more information on the caveats of definitions. Rob wishes to encourage steering a middle course between, on the one hand, the illusion of comfort one might get from having precise definitions, and on the other hand, a too-quick dismissal of 'conceptuality' and definitions that are too loose - so loose that they let in too much, and the power of the idea is lost. This is tricky, and particularly for beginners, who, in the sea of new ideas and practices that they are being exposed to, might understandably want 'textbook'-like definitions to hold on to, but which may then become rigid, etc. In Soulmaking Dharma, all concepts, as well as images, need to have 'soft and elastic edges.'

##### It's quite a large body of work, which would puzzle anyone just picking one talk

```ad-quote
I would say this body of material needs listening to, studying, practising with - all that material around the emptiness, but certainly around the imaginal material, in series. In other words, it adds up. In that way, only then can a person kind of see and understand what is meant in these teachings.
```

```ad-quote
The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were travelled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one insight, one opening led to another, etc., all based on what we might call the 'phenomenological approach,' which is how I would base my approach to the Dharma. It's very, very simple, starting with very, very simple practices, including the ideas of mindfulness, but not based on the usual assumptions.
```

---
##### Very simple practices and the suspension of usual assumptions lead to the availability to look in different ways

##### "Divinity" is a whole range of experiences

```ad-quote
everyone uses the word self: I, you, self, etc. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. It's just the same, or rather it's similar with the notion of divinity. We're talking about experience, okay? Just as 'self' is a word that we use, an experience, so is 'divinity' - or rather, 'divinity' is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of dimensions of experiences, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's experience, _if_ we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out.
```

##### Ideas about divinity are historically and culturally contingent

##### Assumptions and xperiences may be determined by the current dominant Weltanschauung

##### Soul, God, divinity, self, are empty on many levels
<span class="counts">**[[0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^2-5|2-5]]**: _[[The Self]] (5) · [[Experience]] · [[Soul]] (6) · [[Divinity]] (4) · [[Emptiness]] · [[Insight]] (4)_</span>

```ad-quote
Someone with perhaps broader insight will also say something like, "Although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the self and to care for the self." Okay, so there's a psychological wisdom there that's quite important. But again, just the same regarding divinity and soul: although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the soul (what does that mean?), and to care for the soul (what does that mean?).
```

---
##### Even something like "matter" is quickly revealed to be without secure foundations
<span class="counts">**[[0120 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[The Self]]_</span>

![[20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=12:10]]

```ad-quote
It's like, "Matter? It's the most obvious thing," but at a certain point, hmm, what are we actually talking about here? And what, when we talk about it, are we assuming and presuming? And what is the basis for assuming that? Can we be absolutely secure in those assumptions? Or we find out that it's resting on a set of assumptions, or the definition itself - of self, of matter, of whatever it is - is full of contradictions.
```

---
##### There is a kind of incoherence about every concept or experience

```ad-quote
The assumption that this or that is underneath appearances, or it's really matter, or all appearances/perceptions come from the brain, these are all assumptions. What I have is appearances/phenomena. I use the word appearances, experiences, and perceptions interchangeably.
```

##### It's a powerful way into understanding emptiness and the imaginal

```ad-quote
whatever appears to me, I can relate to as a phenomenon and investigate it
```

```ad-quote
if we go deeply enough and radically enough with this phenomenological approach, actually there are ways that it can end up opening what we might call metaphysical philosophy.
```

##### (2) Ways of looking - including the relationship of what I'm perceiving

```ad-quote
So the whole kind of mishmash of conditioning factors in the perceiving makes the way of looking. And there's _always_ a way of looking.
```

##### (3) Fabrication

```ad-quote
So there's a spectrum of fabrication, and different ways of looking fabricate more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive, to much, much less fabricated, less fabricated, less fabricated, etc., down into not fabricating at all. What's fabricated there, as I said, is _dukkha_, is dis-ease and suffering, but also the sense of self, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it.
```

```ad-quote
Without the way of looking, and without being _fabricated_ by the way of looking, there is not the appearance of that thing.
```

---
##### Emptiness is a radical, pervasive concept

![[20170120-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_3-40165.mp3#t=25:31]]

```ad-quote
we start with this notion of ways of looking, and we end up with this really radical, thorough insight that in the end there are only ways of looking. The ways of looking are empty, too, but all we have is a range of ways of looking, which we can expand. And those are not realities; those are ways of looking. Those ways of looking also don't inherently exist. But all we have, all we come to, the freedom that we come to, is there are just ways of looking.
```

##### The concept of ways of looking is compatible with the Four Noble Truths, but can also points beyond it

```ad-quote
An image is an image for me, or imaginally functioning for me, it's imaginal for me, if, for me, at that time, it has a kind of unfathomability to it
```

##### I can keep uncovering truths about them, but I can't reduce them

```ad-quote
So 'imaginal' means not reduced.
```

---
##### An imaginal figure has a kind of otherness and autonomy

```ad-quote
So in the meaning of the word 'image,' it's not just an object. It includes the way of looking at that object
```

---
##### Beauty and sacredness are a feature of image and imaginal practice

```ad-quote
So images, fantasies come in, they pervade, they mix with, they saturate our perception of everything - of self, of other, of world, of being, of path, etc. They operate in our life.
```

```ad-quote
Where there is love, meaningfulness, importance, aliveness, _there_ there is image and fantasy.
```

##### Seeing the image as an image

```ad-quote
But actually _any_ image, it might have an outflow into life, but often that outflow is - it's almost always _not_ literal; it's always subtly kind of refracted or modulated in life in the way that it's expressed.
```

##### (6) Soulmaking

```ad-quote
What's soulmaking? It's anything, any activity or way of looking or way of being, that gives rise to a sense of soulfulness.
```

```ad-quote
when there is soulfulness, there is a sense of importance, of deep importance. This thing is important to me.

```ad-quote
But soulmaking can also mean making soul, making something called soul. So not just soulfulness as an adjective to describe a set of experiences, but also making something called soul.

What kind of entity? Well, it's that entity, that aspect of _citta_, if you like, that facet of _citta_ or being, that which sees or senses in a soulmaking way. That's the entity of soul.

Soulmaking _builds_ soul. It _makes_ soul.

I was contrasting _poiesis_ and _logos_, but actually when I use the word 'logos' in the way _we're_ using it, we're not making a truth claim, other than that everything is empty, and even _that_, actually, you let go of at a certain point. A logos is just a concept that we can pick up, or a conceptual framework we can pick up, without insisting or even believing it as true.

Buddha-nature, _dharmakāya_, emptiness, the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic awareness that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the emptiness of all things, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects). In that sense, it's non-dual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty; this knowing awareness is empty in itself - but the knowing and_ the appearances _and_ their emptiness.
