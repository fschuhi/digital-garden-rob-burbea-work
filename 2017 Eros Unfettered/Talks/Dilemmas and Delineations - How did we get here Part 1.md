##### Why seem others not really interested in awakening?

```ad-quote
And some people don't seem to have an interest or a desire, there's not much libido, if you like, towards awakening in general. They don't talk about it. They don't listen to talks that mention it. When it's talked about, they'll just lose interest. They'll actually say - I've heard many people say to me, "I'm just not interested." So that's interesting, too, to me. Why? What's going on there?
```

##### High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Awakening]] (6) · [[Dharma]] (2) · [[stream-entry]] · [[Hindrances]] · [[Desire]] (2)_</span>

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=22:56]]

```ad-quote
some people (and again, I would also include myself) sort of at the edge of Dharma would even conceive of an endlessly expanding - not quite receding, but endlessly expanding - notion of awakening.
```

```ad-quote
So the desire is always there. The flame of desire never goes out, because there's always more. There's always a greater expansion. There's always more depth and diversity and range to what awakening is and can be. There are always new horizons of awakening opening up.
```

##### Why people go for this kind of path, or that kind of path, or that kind of notion of awakening

##### Practice: allowing dukkha, without acting on it
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Beauty]] · [[Desire]] (6) · [[Awakening]] · [[Dukkha]] (3) · [[Meditation]] · [[Experience]] · [[Retreat]] · [[Passion]] · [[Alchemy]]_</span>

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=25:47]]

```ad-quote
Practising in that way, actually respecting the desire and, if you like, empowering it - without necessarily acting on it; we're talking about a meditation here - practising this way leads to an experience where the desire does not bring _dukkha._ Quite the opposite: it brings a kind of fulfilment and opening of the being.
```

##### Parts of the context: problems coming from wanting to live without clinging; imaginal practice

##### Eros in this retreat expands on imaginal practice, but also explores the role of eros for the path as a whole
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Retreat]] · [[Imaginal]] (3) · [[Eros]] (3) · [[Passion]] · [[Dharma]] (3)_</span>

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=29:06]]

```ad-quote
Why introduce this other word, eros, when we have lots of words, as we elaborated in part one of the first talk? Why bother? Well, that's a good question. It's really a good question. Do we really need another concept here?
```

```ad-quote
there is something deeper running underneath lust and love, something wider than her and me, something so beautifully alive that maybe it shouldn't be renounced so quickly.
```

```ad-quote
I'm just here as a temporary vehicle for a desire that has never begun nor ceased stretching out towards the beloved, so my specific love stories become just some personified renditions of a myth essentially unspoken and inexhaustible.

### Desire and sexuality in the Insight Meditation tradition
##### In the Insight Meditation tradition, sexual energies better not arise
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^8-3|8-3]]**: _[[Retreat]] (2) · [[Meditation]] (2) · [[Image]] (2) · [[Dharma]] (3) · [[Clinging]]_</span>

##### Feet, heart, head, hips

```ad-quote
So Insight Meditation, one of its strengths is how much emphasis it puts on the feet.
```

---
##### Our definition of "eros" includes sexuality, but it's more fundamental and often more subtle
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[Sexuality]] (3) · [[Eros]] (2) · [[Energy]] (2)_</span>

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=43:46]]

```ad-quote
We include sexual attraction, sexual energy, etc. But it's actually much, much more than that. We're talking about something much more fundamental, and also that can be both very intense and very subtle.
```

---
### Why delineate?
#### 1. Because eros is already active in our life, and by delineating it we get a handle on it
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^9-3|9-3]]**: _[[Eros]] (4) · [[Craving]] · [[Desire]] · [[Experience]] · [[Delineations]]_</span>

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=44:37]]

```ad-quote
Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to take it as a theme of investigation. If I don't delineate it in the first place, I can't take it as a theme of investigation.
```

---
##### Eros is connected to divinity, cosmopoesis, soulmaking (to be covered later)

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=45:57]]

```ad-quote
Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to become interested in it, and then we can see how it works. What is this thing? How does it work? And where does it lead, this thing that we're going to call eros?
```

---
#### 2. Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself
<span class="counts">**[[0118 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#^10-1|10-1]]**: _[[Eros]] (5) · [[Experience]] · [[Craving]] · [[Divinity]] (5) · [[Sexuality]] (3)_</span>

![[20170118-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_1-40163.mp3#t=48:12]]

```ad-quote
Sacredness never resides in this or that object or thing; we sacralize. We make something or other sacred through our relationship with it. So there's the possibility of sacralizing sexuality, rather than just viewing eros or sexuality as a defilement, or as leading inevitably to defilement.
```

##### All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present

```ad-quote
I cannot reduce a romantic love relationship or a marriage to _mettā_ . There's something more involved, or that needs to be involved. Part of that 'more' is what we're going to call eros, what we're calling eros.
```

#### 3. Opening a direction of investigation

```ad-quote
And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication.

'clinging,' and all the subtleties and the beauties of working with that in practice: letting go of clinging, moving up and down the spectrum of clinging, and seeing what it does to the fabrication of the perception of self, other, world, time, etc.

One of the immense strengths of the Buddha's teaching and Dharma teaching is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become ways of looking. That's what these concepts are; they become ways of looking. But they serve to simplify. So Dharma concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they fabricate less.

eros is more than _mettā_ ; it's not the same as craving; it's not even just wholesome desire, _hitacchanda,_ or desire that leads to less suffering.
```

```ad-quote
we need a slightly more elaborate Dharma psychology because of the different kinds of sacredness and the different realms of experience which are slightly more involved.
