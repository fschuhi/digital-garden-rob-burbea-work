##### Nobody has a problem with a "Dharma" which mixes in established Western ideas from science or psychotherapy

##### Unpopular or especially foreign ideas are much conspicuous as an addition

##### In any Dharma, fantasy and image is already involved

```ad-quote
And I also insist that this is not a bad thing. Not at all a bad thing. It's inevitable, and it's important, and it may well, I would say, be necessary. It's certainly necessary to galvanize in relation to practice and Dharma, and to be inspired in life, and to have meaningfulness.
```

```ad-quote
We need to recognize both the general fact that it's operating, and also the particular ways that it's operating for us, that fantasy and image operate for us, and the kinds and directions in which fantasy and image operate, and mix in with our life, and impel our life.
```

##### We need to include ideas such as soulmaking or eros

##### "It's just vedana, papanca" is a little bit poor as a psychology

```ad-quote
It's a little bit poor as a psychology. Valuable as it is (we've talked about this), we need something richer, deeper, wider: a psychology that can accommodate and delineate between the kinds of things that we're talking about.

##### The Buddha tells us to find out for ourselves, but we often stop looking further

##### We stop the movement to come find out

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=14:45]]

```ad-quote
I really want to ask and encourage open-mindedness, exploration, practice, that kind of boldness and experimentation, and playing, and willingness to investigate, to question.
```

##### Eros is already in imaginal practice, because imaginal figures always involve love
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Eros]] (8) · [[Imaginal]] (11) · [[Love]] (8) · [[Sexuality]] · [[Image]]_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=15:52]]

```ad-quote
"Notice the love with the imaginal figures." This is really important. Imaginal figures always involve love. Sometimes it's really not obvious at all. Sometimes it can _look_ like the opposite, but there is love there. And there are many different kinds of love, many flavours, characters, expressions of love. This is to be noticed in imaginal practice. And it's both ways. The love is both ways.
```

```ad-quote
these words (opening to, service, surrender) either lead to eros, they deepen the eros, or they already imply that eros is there in the relationship.
```

##### Eros can be steered to lead to samadhi

##### Eros is much more than sexuality but can lead to opening up to questions about it

##### I'm not equating eros with love

##### Sex is possible with and without love, care, eros
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Love]] (6) · [[Pleasantness]] (2) · [[Delineations]] · [[Eros]] (6) · [[Soulmaking]] (2) · [[Imaginal]] · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Image]] · [[Psyche]]_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=22:26]]

```ad-quote
And if it's not clear by now (hopefully it is), we can have eros and an erotic connection with someone with or without sex or sexual contact.
```

---
##### But it's not possible to have eros without love
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Eros]] (5) · [[Love]] (4) · [[Perception]] (3) · [[Beauty]] (2) · [[Divinity]] (3)_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=24:33]]

```ad-quote
eros leads, brings, stimulates, opens a perception of - more and more so, in fact, as it goes on - a perception of the beauty and the divinity. More and more, as I said, this grows, the divinity of the object, of the erotic object. Eros opens the perception of beauty and divinity, and we can't help but love what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine.
```

---
##### Eros is always involved with psyche and logos
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Eros]] (4) · [[Imaginal]] (3) · [[Psyche]] (2) · [[Image]] (2) · [[Logos]] (2) · [[Perception]] · [[Conceptual framework]]_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=25:30]]

##### Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Soulmaking Dynamic]] (5) · [[Eros]] (2) · [[Image]] · [[Imaginal]] (3) · [[Dimensionality]] · [[Logos]] · [[Juiciness]] · [[Psyche]]_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=26:50]]

```ad-quote
eros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands.
```

```ad-quote
There's this mutual insemination, mutual fertilization, growth, expansion, deepening, widening, complexifying, complicating, enrichening of eros-psyche-logos. They all help each other, if you like. They're all involved with and involve each other. That's the eros-psyche-logos dynamic.
```

##### Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception, and vice versa

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=28:18]]

```ad-quote
craving, grasping, aversion, it tends to solidify the perception of that object that we're clinging to.
```

```ad-quote
The reverse is also true, that when a certain perception is solidified, it tends to stimulate the clinging.
```

---
##### The soulmaking dynamic opens out the perception

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=30:00]]

---
##### Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception, it liberates it
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Perception]] (3) · [[Eros]] · [[Image]] (2) · [[Craving]] (2) · [[Aversion]] · [[Clinging]]_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=31:14]]

```ad-quote
But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception, in a certain sense.
```

##### "Eros" can imply this whole dynamic ("big definition")

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=32:24]]

##### Eros is neither inherently positive or negative
<span class="counts">**[[0121 Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Eros]] (3) · [[Craving]] · [[Logos]] · [[Experience]] · [[Soulmaking Dynamic]] · [[Soul]] · [[Soulmaking]]_</span>

![[20170121-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-dilemmas_and_delineations_how_did_we_get_em_here_em_part_4-40166.mp3#t=34:04]]

```ad-quote
Whether eros is fertilizing for the soul, is soulmaking, is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold.
```

##### Eros becomes craving when psyche or logos are taken as really being true
