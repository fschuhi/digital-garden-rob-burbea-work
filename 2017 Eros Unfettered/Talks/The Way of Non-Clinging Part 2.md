##### What are the ways of conceiving this teaching?
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^1-1|1-1]]**: _[[Clinging]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] · [[Beauty]]_</span>

##### Experience of craving and clinging, of something contracting

```ad-quote
This subtle feeling, we get more and more familiar with, and we notice: this is _dukkha_. This contraction itself feels unpleasant.
```

```ad-quote
So actually working directly with the energy of that contraction, and releasing the contraction.
```

---
##### The calmer I get, the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Craving]] (4) · [[Steadiness]] (5) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Mind]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=03:29]]

```ad-quote
And that calmness, like when the water is calm in a pond or a lake or something, I can actually pick up even more subtle levels of craving. So then I can feel that, very subtle, and release those, and even more calm.
```

##### Feel its tension, feel its release
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Beauty]] · [[Craving]] (4) · [[Dukkha]] (6) · [[Fabrication]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=04:24]]

```ad-quote
_Dukkha_ here means something really quite broad in its range, really from quite gross to really, really quite subtle.
```

---
##### Sense of self is fabricated with and by the craving
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[The Self]] (4) · [[Fabrication]] (2) · [[Craving]] (3) · [[Contraction]] · [[Dukkha]] · [[Oneness]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=05:18]]

---
##### Less craving, less self gets fabricated - - fading
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[The Self]] (3) · [[Craving]] (8) · [[Experience]] · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Fabrication]] · [[Attention]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Perception]] (2)_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=06:30]]

```ad-quote
More craving, more self, if you like. Less craving, less self gets fabricated.
```

```ad-quote
More craving, more solid and more dense and more real, if you like, the world becomes, and more oppressive. Let go of craving, let go at a deeper level, start to see these dependencies, start to see objects, too, begin to fade out.
```

##### The tripod of subject, object, time
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Ways of Looking]] (2) · [[Present Moment]] (2) · [[Consciousness]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=08:03]]

---
##### There is always a way of looking, with more or less clinging
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Ways of Looking]] (6) · [[Passion]] · [[Clinging]] (6) · [[Mind]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=09:03]]

```ad-quote
But always at some moment, the mind, the being, is somewhere on that spectrum of how much clinging and what kinds of clinging are going on in the way of looking.
```

---
##### Experience is dependent on the way of looking
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[Ways of Looking]] · [[Clinging]] (4) · [[Experience]] (4) · [[Dukkha]] (3) · [[The Self]] · [[Attention]] · [[Fabrication]] (2)_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=09:56]]

---
##### Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Dukkha]] (4) · [[Clinging]] (4) · [[Beauty]] · [[Craving]] (2) · [[Juiciness]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=10:48]]

```ad-quote
It's not really opening things out in a very deep way, to hang on, to cling, in effect, to a distinction between craving and clinging, for instance.
```

---
##### Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Dependent Origination]] (3) · [[Fabrication]] (5) · [[Experience]] · [[Ways of Looking]] · [[Mind]] (3) · [[Clinging]] (3) · [[The Self]] (2) · [[Perception]] (2)_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=11:44]]

```ad-quote
What does it mean to say that appearances appear, but they are empty? They're dependent arisings. They're fabrications. They're illusory. They do not exist.
```

```ad-quote
This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a dependent arising. It's a fabricated illusion. It is not a thing in itself, without the mind clinging at it or to it.
```

---
##### "Self is an illusion" leads to anatta practice
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[The Self]] (3) · [[Fabrication]] (2) · [[Dependent Origination]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Letting go]] · [[Clinging]] · [[Craving]] · [[Mind]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Sankhara]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Meditation]] (3) · [[Anatta]] (4)_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=13:05]]

---
##### Anatta practice: whatever comes up is not self, not me, not mine
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Ways of Looking]] (4) · [[Anatta]] (2)_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=14:20]]

```ad-quote
This isn't a big, laborious thinking process. It's a way of looking. It's immediate. It's something that's permeating my very perceiving. It's a conception, for sure, but it's also a cutting or replacing of the usual unconscious conception, which is "this is me, this is mine."
```

---
##### Appearences fade because I'm releasing the clinging
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Craving]] · [[Perception]] · [[The Self]] · [[Attention]] · [[Emptiness]] (4) · [[Impermanence]] (3) · [[Clinging]] (2)_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=15:26]]

```ad-quote
They fade in the sense that they blur, they dissolve. They fade into white light or into blackness or whatever. They disappear.
```

---
##### Even the pleasant vedana become neutral, and even those neutral sensations disappear
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Attention]] (2) · [[Pain]] · [[Anatta]] (6) · [[Consciousness]] · [[Vedana]] (6) · [[Impermanence]] · [[Aversion]] · [[Ways of Looking]] (2) · [[Clinging]] · [[Unfabricated]] · [[Experience]] · [[Perception]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=16:28]]

```ad-quote
There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated. And I start to see, again: dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my experience, my perception, and what appears to me.
```

---
##### Not just that is not me, but it is empty
<span class="counts">**[[0116 The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#^4-4|4-4]]**: _[[Anatta]] · [[Perception]] (2) · [[Buddha]] · [[Fabrication]] · [[Ways of Looking]] (3) · [[Attention]]_</span>

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=18:04]]

```ad-quote
Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades.
```

##### Avijja (as belief in an independent reality) is a form of clinging

```ad-quote
in whatever posture in practice, that just sees things, and the way of looking says, "Empty, empty, empty" - meaning I _know_; I don't have to have this shorthand whole thinking thing.
```

---
##### Emptiness practice results in an even deeper level of fading

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=23:31]]

```ad-quote
The mind kind of grasps - like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we're paying attention to. Even attention is a form of clinging.
```

```ad-quote
we see how clinging, craving, _saṅkhārā_, _avijjā_, attention - these notions overlap. They're all different forms of clinging
```

##### "Clinging" has a huge range of subtlelty

![[20170116-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_way_of_non_clinging_part_2-40191.mp3#t=24:39]]

```ad-quote
language is difficult, but eventually there can be a complete unfabricating. Nothing is fabricated at all: no subject, no object, no time (past, future or present), no space. Something that language cannot even approach except by negatives.
```

```ad-quote
Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality? Or is that just a certain level of less fabrication? So I keep this framework of ways of looking and fabrication, and I just see.
```

##### It's the resulting letting go of clinging that unfabricates, not contemplating rapid impermance

If I don't practise, I won't see this. And if I don't practise in certain ways that allow this and make this understanding, I won't see this, I won't understand, and hearing about it certainly won't have much impact.

We need to see this dependent fabrication and dependent fading many, many times, because it's such a deep level of delusion that's entrenched there for us to believe in the reality of things

I can't live without clinging, because clinging is a part of perceiving/experiencing anything. As I said, it's part of attention. And when I really let go of clinging very deeply, in that moment, appearances do not appear. There is no perception.

I cannot have a full leaning on the insight of emptiness at the same time as I have the appearance of an object. It will fade to the degree that I lean on, that I allow the fullness of that knowing of its emptiness into the way of looking.

Actually, even this teaching of dependent origination, all those links, we start to understand, in a way, that that very teaching starts to melt itself. Those links, they melt, they overlap, they blur, they fade. We see they're not real things either.
```

```ad-quote
This was an incredible skill of the Buddha, finding concepts that we can pick up and use as ways of looking, and if we approach it in that spirit, we begin to see that the very ways of looking lead to other ways of looking. The whole thing kind of dissolves itself and opens up a freedom of experience, but also a freedom of understanding, what comes with understanding.
