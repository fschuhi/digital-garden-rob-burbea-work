### Quotes
**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> [A]bsolutely everything that we take for granted, is actually built and fabricated by my relationship to it, by the way I'm looking at it. Not to understand that, the Buddha called that the fundamental delusion, the fundamental ignorance that human beings have, or that consciousnesses have. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Everything is fabricated|Everything is fabricated]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [M]ake the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger. As I said at least once in the instructions, the Buddha says "sensitive to the whole body." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|ad 1. tightness]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the clinging brings release from suffering, and that brings love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release|Alternative: practice ways of looking that bring release]]_</span>

> [L]ove and fear have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the Buddha offered the _mettā_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is an aversion that blocks love|Fear is an aversion that blocks love]]_</span>

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> The very nature of consciousness itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - 'fabricating' is the Buddha's word - fabricating an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience|There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience]]_</span>

> So when the Buddha uses the words "things as they are," what he means, what he meant, was "things as they are" - it's _dependent_, dependent co-arising. They don't exist independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled|The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters|The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past|Ripening of karma from the past]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty|Not just that is not me, but it is empty]]_</span>

> This was an incredible skill of the Buddha, finding concepts that we can pick up and use as ways of looking, and if we approach it in that spirit, we begin to see that the very ways of looking lead to other ways of looking. The whole thing kind of dissolves itself and opens up a freedom of experience, but also a freedom of understanding, what comes with understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The links of dependent origination are not real either|The links of dependent origination are not real either]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> One of the immense strengths of the Buddha's teaching and Dharma teaching is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become ways of looking. That's what these concepts are; they become ways of looking. But they serve to simplify. So Dharma concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they fabricate less. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca|Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca]]_</span>

> We have to get the view right (the view is the platform), and the whole relationship right. So if I say something like that - "Oh, the Buddha said, '_Jhānas_ depend on happiness'" - that should set you thinking. Well, I see some of you writing it down. It's important. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#The view is the platform|The view is the platform]]_</span>

> It means it's not just the joy in someone else's happiness. It _is_ that, and it's all those things I just talked about as well. That's what _muditā_ means in its broader sense, and that's, I think, how the Buddha meant it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#6 Mudita|(6) Mudita]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> So by 'intelligence,' I mean a certain boldness. I mean much more than scholarship: "Well, I go back to the Buddha, and this Pali word means ..." - that's all good, but I mean more than that. I mean a wisdom to discern what is essential. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Intelligence means boldness|Intelligence means boldness]]_</span>

**[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Without me _doing_ something, usually unconsciously, it cannot arise as that emotion. It cannot get fabricated. It cannot get constructed. So in the Buddha's words, we "see a hindrance as a hindrance,"^[Cf. the Buddha's statement at DN 22: "One dwells seeing phenomena as phenomena in terms of the five hindrances" _(dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu nīvaraṇesu)_] and not necessarily as an emotion. We recognize what's there. It's a 'fabrication,' or in other language, it's actually 'empty.' &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication|Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication]]_</span>

> [T]he view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhānas_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one|I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I'm not parking in either one]]_</span>
