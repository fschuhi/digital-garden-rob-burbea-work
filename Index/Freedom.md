### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of .. the vast unknown of death. So in a way can we contemplate the infinite every day, can we contemplate death every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards equanimity, moving towards freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death|This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death]]_</span>

**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So with these three characteristics, one of the indicators that they're working properly is that they bring [[Awakening|freedom]] and love, and not a sense of coldness and disconnection or fear, as I said before.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#The emptiness that opens up from "not me not mine" is inbued with love|The emptiness that opens up from "not me, not mine" is inbued with love]]_</span>

> But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough freedom. There's plenty of freedom in that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#Yes it might be but we are interested in freedom rather than a certain badge|Yes, it might be, but we are interested in freedom, rather than a certain badge]]_</span>

**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering|Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So you're actually using it in the moment as a way of feeling into freedom, of opening up into freedom. It's a way of seeing, a way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#You contemplate impermance in the right way it brings joy|You contemplate impermance in the right way, it brings joy]]_</span>

> So I'm talking about modes of seeing that we can pick up and use, that lead to a sense of freedom. If they lead to a sense of agitation or confusion, existentially or all the rest of it, torment - wrong! Put it away! Do something else. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul" but I don't think that's how insight works|Commentaries point towards a "dark night of the soul", but I don't think that's how insight works]]_</span>

> The deeper we go into this - and it's a very gradual thing, it's a very gradual process - the deeper we go into it, the more freedom is liberated, the more joy, the more peace, the more love and compassion are liberated. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#This far from being nihilistic quite the opposite|This far from being nihilistic, quite the opposite]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So part of what 'practise' means is playing with ways of looking, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way. Let me practise looking at this another way," until that other way, which brings freedom with it, which brings love with it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe|This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if suffering can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of freedom, and love comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled|The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And there are plenty of bodhisattvas in this world, living out a life of compassion, both in the first world and the second world and the third world and - all of it. And one can seek out these people and be around them. There are a lot of remarkable beings out there. And just to let that rub off. Let something of their compassion, but also, in a way, their _abandon,_ because there's freedom in compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Associate with the compassionate|Associate with the compassionate]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters|The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters]]_</span>

> And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"|In mindfulness practice, the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"]]_</span>

> To begin to see into relationship is to begin to see into emptiness. And to begin to see into emptiness is to begin to see into freedom. That's where the deepest freedom is. It's right there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Through loving-kindness and compassion practices we see into the relationship that we have with experience i e into emptiness|Through loving-kindness and compassion practices, we see into the relationship that we have with experience, i.e. into emptiness]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> A degree of freedom of suffering is possible. That's a real faith. That's a wisdom as well. And that's active. It does something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Whatever is going on less suffering is possible|Whatever is going on, less suffering is possible]]_</span>

> And just to remember that emptiness is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for freedom from suffering, for the release from suffering. So compassion is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual|Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Is it possible that liberation, freedom, is actually ever-expanding? Could it be something ever-expanding? It realizes it's in a box, breaks the walls of that box, finds itself in another box, breaks those walls. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#The notion of liberation can be boxed in but in can also be ever-expanding|The notion of liberation can be boxed in, but in can also be ever-expanding]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> This was an incredible skill of the Buddha, finding concepts that we can pick up and use as ways of looking, and if we approach it in that spirit, we begin to see that the very ways of looking lead to other ways of looking. The whole thing kind of dissolves itself and opens up a freedom of experience, but also a freedom of understanding, what comes with understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The links of dependent origination are not real either|The links of dependent origination are not real either]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [W]e start with this notion of ways of looking, and we end up with this really radical, thorough insight that in the end there are only ways of looking. The ways of looking are empty, too, but all we have is a range of ways of looking, which we can expand. And those are not realities; those are ways of looking. Those ways of looking also don't inherently exist. But all we have, all we come to, the freedom that we come to, is there are just ways of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Emptiness is a radical pervasive concept|Emptiness is a radical, pervasive concept]]_</span>
