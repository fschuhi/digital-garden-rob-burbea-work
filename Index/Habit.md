### Quotes
**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Cultivating, developing, reinforcing - remember these habit pattern things we keep talking about. You get a record in a groove. And we're saying, with the _mettā_ and compassion, you can change that groove. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Reinforced grooves of habit can close the doors for the possibility of deep happiness|Reinforced grooves of habit can close the doors for the possibility of deep happiness]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]e're reconditioning the heart and the mind, which essentially, you could say, is a whirlpool, a web of conditioning, of conditions and habits of conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind|Planting the seeds of intention to recondition the mind]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> We need to sit in a _jhāna_ a long time. It's doing a lot of work on the cells, on the being, on the _citta_. It's fine to go through for two seconds on the way - that's all fine, but the real work happens when we really just get in and sit there for a long time, and really let that change our habits, our mental habits, and our energetic habits. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; "marinate" in it|Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; "marinate" in it]]_</span>

> We want it to work on the being. We have to linger. We have to live there. We have to, as I said, marinate, absorb - not just _get_ absorbed, but almost absorb the _jhāna_ itself into our being, get to know it intimately, so that the cells, the mind, the habit patterns of mind, etc., and energy are affected. And in that way it makes a really long-term difference to one's life... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#No achievement badges|No achievement badges]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> And that's something that often goes with anger when anger is not so healthy: it gets very black and white, the thinking and the viewing. But there may well be a relationship between the prevention, the absence, the block, the non-existence of those circuits of movement, gesture, and voice, and the entrenchment and habit of black-and-white thinking and viewing... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Closed circuit might lead to black-and-white thinking|Closed circuit might lead to black-and-white thinking]]_</span>

> If I just remember the principle, the range of what I'm doing will not shrink to just the ones that I'm used to doing, out of habit or indoctrination, or the cultures I've moved in, or whatever it is, or [[History|personal history]], or trauma, whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Practice from the place of a principle to keep the pathways fully available for the influx of soul|Practice from the place of a principle, to keep the pathways fully available for the influx of soul]]_</span>
