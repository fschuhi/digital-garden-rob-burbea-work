<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters|The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters]]_</span>

> [T]he image of walking, wanting to climb a mountain. And there's the mountain in the distance, and one wants to get to the mountain peak, and one has one's vision set on that, but also just the footstep in front of one. And one holds both. And there's a sensitive balance there that's important. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Tanha vs chanda|Tanha vs chanda]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> There's a constrainment of the idea of what's allowed in terms of desire, and also of fantasy and image of what awakening looks like, what kind of desires and involvements an awakened person has, and therefore what we're moving towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed|Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed]]_</span>

> An image is an image for me, or imaginally functioning for me, it's imaginal for me, if, for me, at that time, it has a kind of unfathomability to it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#5 Imaginal image imaginal image|(5) Imaginal, image, imaginal image]]_</span>

> So in the meaning of the word 'image,' it's not just an object. It includes the way of looking at that object... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#An imaginal figure has a kind of otherness and autonomy|An imaginal figure has a kind of otherness and autonomy]]_</span>

> So images, fantasies come in, they pervade, they mix with, they saturate our perception of everything - of self, of other, of world, of being, of path, etc. They operate in our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world|The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world]]_</span>

> But actually _any_ image, it might have an outflow into life, but often that outflow is - it's almost always _not_ literal; it's always subtly kind of refracted or modulated in life in the way that it's expressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Seeing the image as an image|Seeing the image as an image]]_</span>

> [S]omething of the image, and something particularly of the _divinity_ of the image, starts to pervade my sense of the cosmos that I feel myself to be part of. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#17 Cosmopoesis|(17) Cosmopoesis]]_</span>

> [I]mages, as you work with them, when they become really alive, that they have this kind of numinous quality. It's something we notice, rather than we define it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#19 Divinity|(19) Divinity]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> We need to recognize both the general fact that it's operating, and also the particular ways that it's operating for us, that fantasy and image operate for us, and the kinds and directions in which fantasy and image operate, and mix in with our life, and impel our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#In any Dharma fantasy and image is already involved|In any Dharma, fantasy and image is already involved]]_</span>

> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other]]_</span>

> But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception, in a certain sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it|Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception, it liberates it]]_</span>

**[[Daimon, Refracted]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Four Circles, Four Parables of Stone and Light]]</span>
> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that|Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that]]_</span>

> Sometimes you get an image which is not so much a narrative image as much as it has a kind of backstory. It has a kind of imaginal background. So one understands, almost actually implicitly - not like watching a series of events, but one understands implicitly the story or the narrative... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Image Queen trailing blood|Image: Queen, trailing blood]]_</span>

> [I]f my energy body becomes ethereal, it's not the same as melting in union and losing the twoness, losing the differentiation between self and image... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#It's not a problem if you become ethereal|It's not a problem if you become ethereal]]_</span>

> So the image is brought into a very powerful relationship with the self, but it's got all the lightness - I mean, partly helped by the ethereality - but it's got all the lightness of touch of non-identification, or not _over_-identifying, put it that way, and making a rigid ego-identity around it. So there's the duty wrapped up in it, and the sense of self, and the way this image then informs and flows into the self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image|Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image]]_</span>

> My soul is informed, has the impression, has the stamp of these deep soul-images - Coltrane, Hendrix, this friend or that friend, etc. And I treasure that. I treasure that. I _want_ to be impressed upon in that way. I want to be impressed upon. Don't we, as souls, _want_ to be impressed upon by soul, and by what is soulful? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression|Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression]]_</span>

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real]]_</span>

> [I]mages, imaginal beings, angels that sometimes are kind of in conflict with each other, or at least move, pull us, draw us, beckon us in different directions; ask of us impossibly divergent things. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Polytheistic psyche|Polytheistic psyche]]_</span>

> So sometimes connecting with an image and recognizing, feeling, opening to its love for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the dimensionality and the divinity and the beauty, etc., that, in a way, that kind of love, the love that images have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned love, it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The love images have for us can heal the inner critic|The love images have for us can heal the inner critic]]_</span>

> So there's the particular, unique way these ten _Sefirot_ manifest and express through me. So something that can start as an apparently impersonal image, or even sound like it, actually can be, by including the narrative and the particulars and the uniqueness, can be rendered more unique, retain its particularities, retain its personhood and uniqueness to self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#My particularities were retained in the meditation not just a universal kind of manifestation of God|My particularities were retained in the meditation, not just a universal kind of manifestation of God]]_</span>

**[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> You need a fantasy of yourself as a practitioner - you know, a juicy, soulmaking, beautiful image fantasy of yourself, something that's operating in the background, a fantasy of the tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#You need a fantasy of the retreat|You need a fantasy of the retreat]]_</span>

> '[F]antasy' as opposed to 'image.' They're almost subliminal. They're just kind of really nourishing and supporting, lubricating our whole sense of what we're doing, giving moisture there, giving beauty and depth. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#There fantasies operate in the background|There fantasies operate in the background]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
>  And I find more and more these days, when things are difficult, when there's challenge different ways, that the sense (and I mean that word in its double meaning: the sense, the actual [[perception]], and the idea) of my human being or another human being is more along the lines of this [[Image|image and analogue]], of having [[Dimensionality|angelic dimensions]] which are refracted into the human life more or less at different times, with a [[duty]] to that.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#The sense and sensing of being larger having angelic dimensions|The sense and sensing of being larger, having angelic dimensions]]_</span>

> You're taking it to another level, really, dropping any idea of an attempt to express or convey any meaning, something that _could_ get put into words, or an emotion. You're not conveying or expressing an emotion, or an [[image]], or an event, or a story, or my story, or your story, or whatever it is. There's just [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, and voice]]. And dropping any sense of an attempt to express something with that, to convey something that _means_ anything with that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Drop any idea of an attempt to express some meaning|Drop any idea of an attempt to express some meaning]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> You're doing this in dyadic relationship with an image. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the body and make gestures and vocalize to the [[Daimon|angel]], to your angel who is your dyad partner, to the image there, to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the [[blessing]] and just the mystery of that communication from the angel, in your imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Rather than actual person dyad partner is intrapsychic image|Rather than actual person, dyad partner is intrapsychic image]]_</span>

> But actually to hold a fully authentic imaginal image, and be in relation to that image, and dance at the same time, in a way that both the dancing and the image, the soulfulness of both and the sensing with soul of both, is kind of mutually enhanced and mutually woven together and implicated, that's quite hard for most people - even most people who have a practice of dance, etc., and of the imaginal.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult|Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult]]_</span>

> Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the [[image]], that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole [[Gestalt Psychology|gestalt]], the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole image, that whole time, that icon, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the body [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, voice]], or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Embodying reflecting refracting|Embodying, reflecting, refracting]]_</span>
