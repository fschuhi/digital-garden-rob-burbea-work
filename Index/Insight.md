### Quotes
**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough freedom. There's plenty of freedom in that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#Yes it might be but we are interested in freedom rather than a certain badge|Yes, it might be, but we are interested in freedom, rather than a certain badge]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal. That universality, seeing that, understanding that, brings equanimity, as I said, but brings very deep compassion, because it's got very deep wisdom with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#The true nature of all things is immeasurable|The true nature of all things is immeasurable]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So any seeing or understanding that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of dukkha - that's what we call "insight." Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just intellectual understanding, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of suffering, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an insight. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering|General definition of insight: that which brings lessening of suffering]]_</span>

> Actually we need to see this over and over and over and over and over, until finally the coin drops, and seeing it over and over, and practicing it, it deepens. The insight deepens and becomes unshakeable, becomes unshakeable. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#What qualities do I need to cultivate that actually lead to a lessening of suffering|What qualities do I need to cultivate that actually lead to a lessening of suffering]]_</span>

> Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference|Impermanence is an obvious fact, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> I find nothing but perceptions, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this impermanence can lead to an understanding of emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world|Those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world]]_</span>

> So it's a different question than, "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a noise?" It's not going there, to that question. It's avoiding that question. We're talking about experience and understanding experience in the light of suffering arising or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that|Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But compassion as such is not blind. Compassion has in it some degree of understanding of what the causes of suffering are, and in it, a willingness and a wish to uncover the causes of suffering, at as deep a level as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity and wisdom|Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity, and wisdom]]_</span>

**[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So because we're most intimate with this psychophysical organism, that's where we learn the most. And that wisdom then translates and transfers into compassion for others, because we understand the roots of suffering.

> A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego|Compassion to self does not build the ego]]_</span>

> And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom.

> The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any experience is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of insight. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it|The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Sometimes we're _too_ cautious perhaps. And perhaps there _is_ a place for stretching ourselves, stretching our limits, just saying, "To hell with myself and my self-concern," and just a kind of abandon. Maybe that has its place. Or rather, it definitely has its place, but it needs to be approached with wisdom. And stretching the limits of one's stamina and one's endurance in serving and in giving - there is the place for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#We have to respect where we are in our humanity|We have to respect where we are in our humanity]]_</span>

> So a talk, or a Dharma teaching, or whatever it is, an insight, is actually just a seed. And then it needs to meet a lot of other conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The talk is landing in a lot of different mind states|The talk is landing in a lot of different mind states]]_</span>

> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past|Ripening of karma from the past]]_</span>

> A degree of freedom of suffering is possible. That's a real faith. That's a wisdom as well. And that's active. It does something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Whatever is going on less suffering is possible|Whatever is going on, less suffering is possible]]_</span>

> That's what wisdom or insight or _paññā_ means: we're understanding the causes and conditions that lead to suffering. And out of that very understanding is born compassion. That very understanding will bring with it compassion. So one could never go anywhere near loving-kindness practice or compassion practice, and just the deepening of the insight will bring compassion naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the causes and conditions and _understanding_ that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering|Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering]]_</span>

But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our understanding of emptiness is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates compassion, then you put down the emptiness as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of compassion, and you relate in terms of beings suffering and my response to their suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story 9 11 was not "nothing happened"|Story: 9/11 was not "nothing happened"]]_</span>
