> [W]hen the [compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) has gone off into righteous anger or we feel that kind of anger come in, it's actually painful for us. So sometimes this might happen in the course of your practice, if you're giving compassion to the difficult person. To take a moment and just give the compassion to oneself, recognizing there's some pain there. If I'm involved in judgment, if I'm involved in blame, in anger, in all that, my heart is burning, my heart is [contracted](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Contraction) and painful. Just to take a moment, and turn round, and feel that pain, and touch it with compassion to oneself, and then to go out again. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#When feeling the pain of anger coming in remember to give compassion to yourself|When feeling the pain of anger coming in, remember to give compassion to yourself]]_</span>

> We tend to think of a storehouse of old emotions: "Here's anger. I need to release it. I need it to come up." But it cannot come up unless the conditions in the present moment are there for it to come up. And sometimes when we're really clear, we can actually see this process, that if we don't feed it in the present, it doesn't come up. It _cannot_ come up. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#When the samadhi is around drop in a thought of what's difficult|When the samadhi is around, drop in a thought of what's difficult]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Give the compassion to the self, and the being, the heart, can soften and open. And then perhaps the compassion can flow. When we're caught up in anger, we are hurting. When we're caught up in blame and judgment, we are hurting. Sometimes we don't realize it. So, compassion to the self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Remaining percipient of what's beautiful; redirect compassion towards ourselves|Remaining percipient of what's beautiful; redirect compassion towards ourselves]]_</span>

> Whatever it is that comes up, if there's resistance or numbness, holding that in kindness. Total, complete welcoming. If there's no feeling, if there's boredom, anger, fear, confusion, whatever it is in this moment, bathing it in love, totally welcoming it, over and over. Nothing is exempt. Nothing is out of the range. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#If there's resistence or numbness - holding it in kindness|If there's resistence or numbness - holding it in kindness]]_</span>

> [A]nger _colours_ the perception at times. And we even have a phrase in English: one is 'seeing red.' I was seeing red, or he's seeing red; she's seeing red. The very words are implying this colouring of perception. One's looking at the world, at the situation in that moment, through the lenses of anger. And the perception is correspondingly changed - of a person, of ourselves, of a situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Example angers colours the perception and so does metta|Example: angers colours the perception, and so does metta]]_</span>

> And in that anger is power. The third step there would be, can I almost filter out the sense of power in the energy body from the feeling of anger? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#2 Imagine destroying the inner critic violently|(2) Imagine destroying the inner critic violently]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> And that's something that often goes with anger when anger is not so healthy: it gets very black and white, the thinking and the viewing. But there may well be a relationship between the prevention, the absence, the block, the non-existence of those circuits of movement, gesture, and voice, and the entrenchment and habit of black-and-white thinking and viewing... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Closed circuit might lead to black-and-white thinking|Closed circuit might lead to black-and-white thinking]]_</span>
