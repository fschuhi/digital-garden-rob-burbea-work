### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> Who cares, who cares. These things are completely dependent, completely relative on.. to our state of mind. In themselves they don't have any power, they don't have any inherent power: praise-blame, success-failure, gain-loss, all the rest of it; don't have any power inherently to effect us even. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#Example Accident with a newly bought Ferrari|Example: Accident with a newly bought Ferrari]]_</span>

**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> They are also subject not just to death but to the uncertainty and change that is, in a way, woven into the fabric of the moment of our lives. They don't know what the next moment will bring, what will happen to the mind, to the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#They are also subject to the uncertainties of live|They are also subject to the uncertainties of live]]_</span>

> The [sense of self](app://obsidian.md/The%20Self) is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is impermanence, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of mind moments, a continuum of experiences through time. So impermanence can lead to the others like that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#The resulting letting go is not disconnection and it can lead to an understanding of anatta|The resulting letting go is not disconnection, and it can lead to an understanding of anatta]]_</span>

**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> No perception, no mind. They go together. To have a mind, you need to have a perception. If there's no world, there's no perception and no mind. The mind is inextricably linked up with what it perceives, which is the universe. Mind is not separate from the world. It feels separate. Self feels separate from others, from the world, from the universe. Mind feels separate. This is the great delusion. Not separate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions|Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions]]_</span>

**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Mind always has some mind state. So with [mindfulness](app://obsidian.md/mindfulness), there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love|But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love]]_</span>

> So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation|Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation]]_</span>

> But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no thing, there is no real thing that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#The appearance of something depends on the grasping|The appearance of something depends on the grasping]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So the mind, the heart, the being staying steady, staying balanced, unshakeable, whatever happens, whatever's going on, whatever is coming to the senses. Sometimes to ask ourselves: how much does my mind state depend on what's going on? This happens or that happens; how much does the mind state wobble with that? A steadiness with it is what equanimity is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is steadiness in the face of all conditions|Equanimity is steadiness in the face of all conditions]]_</span>

> So it has a certain feeling-tone, equanimity, to it, a certain peacefulness, a certain stillness, and it's the mind kind of tuning into that wavelength, that resonance, and just being there with it, noticing it, feeling it, opening to it, and enjoying it, enjoying it, that allows it to deepen, to settle in the being. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#3 Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity|(3) Equanimity deepens when the mind tunes into the feeling-tone of equanimity]]_</span>

> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**

> It was just interesting to notice that I could actually just decide to be sad or happy. Don't have to be a victim; there's some choice. Not _always_ one would have this choice.

> The mind is _not_ like it appears to be right now, it's _not_ clouded, it's _not_ clear, it's _not_ deep, it's _not_ shallow, I'm _not_ sitting here, you're _not_ sitting there, this is _not_ Gaia House, this is _not_ a meditation retreat.

> What's almost always lacking with fear is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the fear and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing mindfulness to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable.

> If the _samādhi_ feels strong enough or there's a sense of settledness in the mind and the heart with the compassion, it can be almost, at times, as if the body has _turned into_ compassion.

> The mind, the heart begins to soften because one's meeting oneself with _mettā - can_ do.

> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context.

> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality?

> [A]s practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our awareness to be able to notice mind states. If we're calling eros a mind state or a state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the energy body is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of mind, and what we might call the space of mind, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they're underneath or alongside thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind|We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind]]_</span>

> Sometimes the mind will just do something that you think, "Wow, that's amazing," you know?

> We want it to work on the being. We have to linger. We have to live there. We have to, as I said, marinate, absorb - not just _get_ absorbed, but almost absorb the _jhāna_ itself into our being, get to know it intimately, so that the cells, the mind, the habit patterns of mind, etc., and energy are affected.

> [T]here's something in the way I'm seeing this and relating to this actually really lovely thing, and I'm somehow spinning it with a negative - I'm seeing it through a negative lens.

Yes, this part of the body doesn't feel quite connected, or feels a bit constricted, or the mind - so I'm just pointing to that, I dive into it, and then what's my work there? I've dived in. Now I'm in touch with that peacefulness. Now what? Now I need to work with that, get into it, enjoy it, open to it, focus on it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#The jhanas are there anways you can point the mind to a peaceful level|The jhanas are there anways, you can point the mind to a peaceful level]]_</span>

It might still be quite strong; I'm really quite restless in the body, but there's no story attached to it. There's no lostness.
