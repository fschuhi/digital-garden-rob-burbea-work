### Quotes
**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all Dharma joy, spiritual joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself|Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself]]_</span>

> So at times, we can be in a mode of practice where we're just letting everything come up and everything go. We're just into the impermanence of it, and that's totally fine. And other times, we're very interested in cultivating the joy, and we're deliberately in a mode of nourishing something, nurturing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#But we can also cultivate joy|But we can also cultivate joy]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> We need, and particularly on a retreat like this, we need to take care, as much as possible, of a kind of baseline foundation of our sense of well-being, nourish our sense of happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It works also in the reverse the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness|It works also in the reverse: the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Holding it all in compassion. Allowing it to be held in compassion. Realizing, reflecting: nothing, absolutely nothing is outside this web, this infinite web. Sustaining us, nourishing us, giving to us. And that we too are part of that web. Sensitive to suffering. Letting it be held in compassion. And just allowing a sense of space to open up. And allowing the body to just radiate out compassion in space, filling space, all space, all directions. Filling it with that tenderness, with that healing. Holding all things in compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to all animals and plant life|Compassion to all animals and plant life]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So it's really not about self-improvement, and the whole notion of a self to improve begins to just loosen in time with practice. And yet, we can still be really committed to this process of cultivation, of developing the nourishment, of reconditioning. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Cultivation is not about self-improvement|Cultivation is not about self-improvement]]_</span>

> [W]hat he taught much more is this wholesome nourishment, wholesome developing of what's beautiful, and the well-being that that provides, and the _well_ of well-being that that provides_, and_ investigation. It's not that he taught a particular technique or you have to do this or that. It's those two together that were taught. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation but well-being and investigation|The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation, but well-being and investigation]]_</span>

> The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters|The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving|Recap: balancing of receiving and giving]]_</span>

> In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that spaciousness, where whatever suffering there is or whatever suffering could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that experience and then actually nurture it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The more we encourage this spaciousness the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it|The more we encourage this spaciousness, the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it]]_</span>

> [T]here's a faith in it - faith in that, and also faith that it's possible for me. It's possible for me to cultivate - wherever I am now, whatever lack of beautiful qualities I seem to have when I look inside, however impoverished I feel - it's possible for me, it's possible for this being, this heart, this mind, to cultivate beautiful qualities and grow, let them grow. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#1 Cultivation of beautiful qualities brings well-being and happiness and security|(1) Cultivation of beautiful qualities brings well-being and happiness and security]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Can I have a conceptual framework, can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a fantasy that, actually, romantic love becomes part of the path, and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot nourish those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap|When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about, the whole structure will snap]]_</span>

> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors|Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors]]_</span>

> It doesn't open that up. It doesn't nourish it. It doesn't bring water to it. It doesn't fan the fire. It doesn't bring out the beauty, reveal the beauty, the dimensions there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Certain viewpoints cannot fan the fire|Certain viewpoints cannot fan the fire]]_</span>

> It's part of the whole kind of energetic awareness we want to gradually cultivate, this bubble of resource.
