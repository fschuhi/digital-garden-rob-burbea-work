### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no thing, there is no real thing that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#The appearance of something depends on the grasping|The appearance of something depends on the grasping]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> It's pointing to seeing this: the more I cling in any way, the more prominent experience is in consciousness. I begin to understand _how_ things arise and _how_ they fade. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Satipatthana Sutta|Satipatthana Sutta]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Unhappiness, joy, whatever it is, just don't cling. Let it come, let it go. But maybe there's more to it than that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Yes don't cling|Yes, don't cling]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the clinging brings release from suffering, and that brings love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release|Alternative: practice ways of looking that bring release]]_</span>

> When we release clinging, the heart centre opens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> By 'clinging,' I mean pushing away what we don't like, over-identifying with things, trying to hold on to things, to grasp at things - all that is clinging. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's clinging around|We can develop our capacity to become sensitive to when there's clinging around]]_</span>

> [T]hat body sense will reflect to me, will indicate to me when there's clinging around - holding, pushing, struggling, identifying - because some kind of contraction and tension comes into the bodily experience, even if it's very subtle. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around|The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around]]_</span>

**[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> One sees what one's doing, what one's clinging to right there and then, and it just can unhook it - because there's this attunement to suffering, because of the compassion practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#The lens of compassion is used to tune into any subtle manifestation of suffering|The lens of compassion is used to tune into any subtle manifestation of suffering]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> But always at some moment, the mind, the being, is somewhere on that spectrum of how much clinging and what kinds of clinging are going on in the way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#There is always a way of looking with more or less clinging|There is always a way of looking, with more or less clinging]]_</span>

> It's not really opening things out in a very deep way, to hang on, to cling, in effect, to a distinction between craving and clinging, for instance. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice|Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice]]_</span>

> This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a dependent arising. It's a fabricated illusion. It is not a thing in itself, without the mind clinging at it or to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory]]_</span>

> The mind kind of grasps - like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we're paying attention to. Even attention is a form of clinging. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even attention is a form of clinging|Even attention is a form of clinging]]_</span>

> [W]e see how clinging, craving, _saṅkhārā_, _avijjā_, attention - these notions overlap. They're all different forms of clinging... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even attention is a form of clinging|Even attention is a form of clinging]]_</span>

> I can't live without clinging, because clinging is a part of perceiving/experiencing anything. As I said, it's part of attention. And when I really let go of clinging very deeply, in that moment, appearances do not appear. There is no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving|I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving]]_</span>

> [D]on't cling to non-clinging. It's empty, and it's wrapped up in perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#No clinger no clung to no clinging|No clinger, no clung to, no clinging]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [I]s it even possible to create a large form (say a long piece of music, or a novel, or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time) without craving, clinging, attachment, desire? Or training - the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Art sexuality without desire|Art, sexuality without desire?]]_</span>

> _[A]vijjā_ is clinging, this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the way of looking. It's a clinging. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that clinging of delusion up and down on a spectrum, and see what happens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#2 spectrum of fabrication emptiness|2. spectrum of fabrication (emptiness)]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> '[C]linging,' and all the subtleties and the beauties of working with that in practice: letting go of clinging, moving up and down the spectrum of clinging, and seeing what it does to the fabrication of the perception of self, other, world, time, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It also fits with emptiness teachings|It also fits with emptiness teachings]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [C]linging, we might use it to refer to that whole spectrum in that broader sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#12 Clinging|(12) Clinging]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [C]raving, grasping, aversion, it tends to solidify the perception of that object that we're clinging to. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception and vice versa|Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception, and vice versa]]_</span>

> The reverse is also true, that when a certain perception is solidified, it tends to stimulate the clinging. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception and vice versa|Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception, and vice versa]]_</span>

> But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception, in a certain sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it|Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception, it liberates it]]_</span>
