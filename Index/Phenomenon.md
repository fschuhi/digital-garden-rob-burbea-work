### Quotes
**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Everything is so fleeting. And so things, phenomena, _dharmas_ are fleeting by their nature, when we look at them. And in a way, you could say, they're deserving of compassion. They're impoverished. They barely last. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Phenomena are fleeting by their nature so they are deserving of compassion|Phenomena are fleeting by their nature, so they are deserving of compassion]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> The assumption that this or that is underneath appearances, or it's really matter, or all appearances/perceptions come from the brain, these are all assumptions. What I have is appearances/phenomena. I use the word appearances, experiences, and perceptions interchangeably. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#1 Phenomenological approach|(1) Phenomenological approach]]_</span>
