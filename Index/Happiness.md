### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> [R]eally putting a lot of time, energy, effort into cultivating a heart of loving-kindness. Then that's there in the heart, it's a quality that's a frequent guest in the heart. That makes a huge difference, because kindness is a quality that brings happiness, it brings happiness. A heart of metta is a happy heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#A heart of metta is a happy heart|A heart of metta is a happy heart]]_</span>

> A spiritual joy, doesn't have so much to do with the self. So one aspect of spiritual joy, we could say, is wonder, wonder. That quality of just a human being wondering, marveling.. a human being in awe at life, at existence, at the universe... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#Spiritual joy|Spiritual joy]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> How is it that my well of joy, my reservoir of inner happiness, can be deepened in life? And so looking into: how does the being open to wonder? How does it open to the mystery of life, to the awe of things? What's the place of art and music in that? What's the place of our relationship with nature? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#When feel like we have enough external circumstances make less of an impact|When feel like we have enough, external circumstances make less of an impact]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> The deeper we go into this - and it's a very gradual thing, it's a very gradual process - the deeper we go into it, the more freedom is liberated, the more joy, the more peace, the more love and compassion are liberated. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#This far from being nihilistic quite the opposite|This far from being nihilistic, quite the opposite]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all Dharma joy, spiritual joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself|Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself]]_</span>

> Joy brings openness. It's purifying. Joy is also clarifying. So a joyful state has a lot more clarity in it than an unhappy state, which tends to be quite confused, agitated. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#The more joy we have just coming and going the more we feel we have enough|The more joy we have just coming and going, the more we feel we have enough]]_</span>

> Its natural movement in the fullness of time is to move towards equanimity - a beautiful, rich, deep equanimity. That's just the way joy matures. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Joy moves naturally towards equanimity|Joy moves naturally towards equanimity]]_</span>

> "Feeders on joy are we." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#The presence of joy can relativize a lot of other things in our life |The presence of joy can relativize a lot of other things in our life.]]_</span>

> "He who tries to hold to a joy does the winged life destroy. But he who kisses a joy as it flies lives to see eternity's sunrise." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Yes don't cling|Yes, don't cling]]_</span>

> Unhappiness, joy, whatever it is, just don't cling. Let it come, let it go. But maybe there's more to it than that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Yes don't cling|Yes, don't cling]]_</span>

> So at times, we can be in a mode of practice where we're just letting everything come up and everything go. We're just into the impermanence of it, and that's totally fine. And other times, we're very interested in cultivating the joy, and we're deliberately in a mode of nourishing something, nurturing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#But we can also cultivate joy|But we can also cultivate joy]]_</span>

> And I remember sitting there and sort of taking in the whole beauty of the life unfolding. And of course what was very much absent was this critical, "Right. Wrong. That wasn't quite good enough," etc. And such joy and delight and appreciation of just the beauty of humanity sort of coming together, and living, and life just manifesting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Contrast relaxed listening to an Arabic music concert|Contrast: relaxed listening to an Arabic music concert]]_</span>

> Mindfulness, when there's mindfulness, attentiveness, presence, with curiosity and the curiosity of investigation, that can be there, and a kind of energy with that, that we're injecting some energy into that. That brings joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Mindfulness i e the its energy brings joy|Mindfulness (i.e. the its energy) brings joy]]_</span>

> So joy, happiness actually does have a vibration in the body, has a resonance there, reverberation. And if we can tune into that and just hold that in our attentiveness... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Attention to joy itself feeds joy|Attention to joy itself feeds joy]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> We need, and particularly on a retreat like this, we need to take care, as much as possible, of a kind of baseline foundation of our sense of well-being, nourish our sense of happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It works also in the reverse the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness|It works also in the reverse: the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the body sensitivity, or the body feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of happiness - actually connecting with that in the body, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the body, just a vague, unremarkable sense of well-being. That connection with those kinds of feelings in the body helps the _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper|Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper]]_</span>

> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade|When we let go, we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>

> [H]ow much deep happiness is available for someone cultivating those qualities of heart, cultivating greed long-term? How much deep happiness is available to them? Cultivating insensitivity long-term - so, sure, they might have the riches, and they might have this and that. But in the heart, how much deep happiness is available? They're actually - when _any_ of us acts that way in the world, we're closing the doors for the possibility of deep happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Reinforced grooves of habit can close the doors for the possibility of deep happiness|Reinforced grooves of habit can close the doors for the possibility of deep happiness]]_</span>

> [A] little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the happiness makes compassion enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing. And we need to kind of feel that energy in the body, that energy going, or even just imagine it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#You can play with this it's not a static balance|You can play with this, it's not a static balance]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> When we have joy, when we're familiar and have familiar access with a sense of joy in our life, we have enough. And then we're less shakeable in this life and in relationship to our suffering and the suffering of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#As the samadhi deepens it brings with it joy|As the samadhi deepens, it brings with it joy]]_</span>

> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past|Ripening of karma from the past]]_</span>

> '[B]liss' as an experience of the energy body, of great pleasantness in the energy body, of rapture or joy in the energy body, and that kind of openness, etc., sometimes very intense, sometimes much more subtle. {quote But that energy body experience of bliss, I would say, accompanies _any_ lightening or unfabricating, to whatever degree, of the self-sense, up to a certain point, at least. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The "bliss" of soulmaking"|The "bliss" of soulmaking"]]_</span>

**[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> We have to get the view right (the view is the platform), and the whole relationship right. So if I say something like that - "Oh, the Buddha said, '_Jhānas_ depend on happiness'" - that should set you thinking. Well, I see some of you writing it down.

> It means it's not just the joy in someone else's happiness. It _is_ that, and it's all those things I just talked about as well.

> I say, well, just try. Sometimes I say, "Okay, just turn down the aversion." You say, "What do you mean, 'turn down'? I don't know how to do it." Just try. Just try to turn down the aversion, because turning down the aversion can then just directly give rise to happiness, give rise to _sukha_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#iii Turn down any aversion in the mind which helps sukha to arise|(iii) Turn down any aversion in the mind, which helps sukha to arise]]_</span>
