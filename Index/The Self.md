### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> So this is quite interesting. Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of equanimity is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of juiciness, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of the self, the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe equanimity, true equanimity, actually has a quality of juiciness in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life|The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life]]_</span>

> A spiritual joy, doesn't have so much to do with the self. So one aspect of spiritual joy, we could say, is wonder, wonder. That quality of just a human being wondering, marveling.. a human being in awe at life, at existence, at the universe... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#Spiritual joy|Spiritual joy]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The [sense of self](app://obsidian.md/The%20Self) is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is impermanence, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of mind moments, a continuum of experiences through time. So impermanence can lead to the others like that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#The resulting letting go is not disconnection and it can lead to an understanding of anatta|The resulting letting go is not disconnection, and it can lead to an understanding of anatta]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> There's absolutely love in it. In that state, there's a kind of non-separation. We're not building a sense of self and other, a sense of separation, by getting involved in this tussle, in this push and pull. In the non-separation, there's love, effortlessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#There is wonder beauty love and juiciness in equanimity practice|There is wonder, beauty, love and juiciness in equanimity practice]]_</span>

> You can't stay forever in a state of not defining the self, but if you do it enough and repeatedly enough, when you go back to defining the self, you just know, "Well, this is just a conventional definition," and you're not bound by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Rob Put away all the self-definition aside and see what's what|Rob: Put away all the self-definition aside and see what's what]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And there's a way that the self and the very individuality and uniqueness of the self is inextricably bound up with, actually, _everything else_ in the whole universe. We have a delusion of separateness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe|This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe]]_</span>

> Without belief in the self, there can't really be fear. Where is the fear going to take root? It's around self. When we begin to understand, deeply and in the heart, this emptiness of self, we realize there's actually nothing real here to protect, to defend, to worry about, and fear gets released at a very deep level in our lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life|We want to understand something about what the self is, and how it is, in a way that brings freedom into our life]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>

> Give the compassion to the self, and the being, the heart, can soften and open. And then perhaps the compassion can flow. When we're caught up in anger, we are hurting. When we're caught up in blame and judgment, we are hurting. Sometimes we don't realize it. So, compassion to the self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Remaining percipient of what's beautiful; redirect compassion towards ourselves|Remaining percipient of what's beautiful; redirect compassion towards ourselves]]_</span>

**[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego|Compassion to self does not build the ego]]_</span>

> '[C]linging,' and all the subtleties and the beauties of working with that in practice: letting go of clinging, moving up and down the spectrum of clinging, and seeing what it does to the fabrication of the perception of self, other, world, time, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It also fits with emptiness teachings|It also fits with emptiness teachings]]_</span>

> '[B]liss' as an experience of the energy body, of great pleasantness in the energy body, of rapture or joy in the energy body, and that kind of openness, etc., sometimes very intense, sometimes much more subtle. {quote But that energy body experience of bliss, I would say, accompanies _any_ lightening or unfabricating, to whatever degree, of the self-sense, up to a certain point, at least. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The "bliss" of soulmaking"|The "bliss" of soulmaking"]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Someone with perhaps broader insight will also say something like, "Although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the self and to care for the self." Okay, so there's a psychological wisdom there that's quite important. But again, just the same regarding divinity and soul: although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the soul (what does that mean?), and to care for the soul (what does that mean?). &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Soul God divinity self are empty on many levels|Soul, God, divinity, self, are empty on many levels]]_</span>

> So there's a spectrum of fabrication, and different ways of looking fabricate more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive, to much, much less fabricated, less fabricated, less fabricated, etc., down into not fabricating at all. What's fabricated there, as I said, is _dukkha_, is dis-ease and suffering, but also the sense of self, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#3 Fabrication|(3) Fabrication]]_</span>

> [W]hen we talk about the _imaginal_ Middle Way, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of the self, a dissolving, a disappearing, a fading of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#We are free to entertain any sense of self|We are free to entertain any sense of self]]_</span>

> So the image is brought into a very powerful relationship with the self, but it's got all the lightness - I mean, partly helped by the ethereality - but it's got all the lightness of touch of non-identification, or not _over_-identifying, put it that way, and making a rigid ego-identity around it. So there's the duty wrapped up in it, and the sense of self, and the way this image then informs and flows into the self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image|Our persona being a very particular refraction of the quality of the image]]_</span>

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real]]_</span>

> [T]here is the possibility of sensing the self with soul, sensing the self as a temporal emanation of what is timeless, the angel, a theophany. We hold it lightly, and in that light holding of it, as I said, it can have enormous power, bear enormous fruit, something very, very beautiful. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Our culture doesn't really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being|Our culture doesn't really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being]]_</span>

> Allowing yourself to stop, pause, and sense, and taking the pressure off that way, but remaining attentive and connected and alive and attuned to the experience of self, other, world, energy body, and emotional body. And then, perhaps, out of that, out of that sensitivity and attunement in the pause comes the instigation, the seed of the next movement or gesture or [vocalization]. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#In case of feeling uncomfortable the blesser is allowing themselves to pause sense the space they're in Method 1|In case of feeling uncomfortable, the blesser is allowing themselves to pause, sense the space they're in (Method 1)]]_</span>

> The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of [[anxiety]], or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the [[awareness]]. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There might be self-consciousness arising|There might be self-consciousness arising]]_</span>

> Because when there's sensing with soul, it will tend to counter that kind of reified and [[Contraction|contracted]] [[The Self|self-consciousness]], self-obsession, because that's not really a soul-movement. It may be a kind of squeezed, impoverished reflection of what's, if you like, originally a soul-movement, but in itself, it's not. So when we sense with soul, something opens that out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness|Sensing anything with soul also counters the contracted self-consciousness]]_</span>
