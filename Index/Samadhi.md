### Quotes
**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So softness - in a way the opposite of tightness - softness is actually a factor of _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|ad 1. tightness]]_</span>

> When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the body. So part of the art of meditation, part of the art of deepening _samādhi_, is to have this kind of background awareness of breadth of the body awareness, and be sensitive to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|ad 1. tightness]]_</span>

> The mind is _not_ like it appears to be right now, it's _not_ clouded, it's _not_ clear, it's _not_ deep, it's _not_ shallow, I'm _not_ sitting here, you're _not_ sitting there, this is _not_ Gaia House, this is _not_ a meditation retreat. It can be hard to understand that without having gone through the depth of _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#A deep understanding of non-duality is that actually there's no "way things are"|A deep understanding of non-duality is that actually there's no "way things are"]]_</span>

> [L]ove for the self, love for others, love for nature, for all things, for all beings. That's a kind of mark of _samādhi_ as it deepens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Love comes from doing samadhi practice|Love comes from doing samadhi practice]]_</span>

> This is a very fluid, very responsive practice. One of the skills in _samādhi_ practice, one of the skills in _mettā_ practice, is responsiveness. So what is the way of using the phrases or leaving the phrases that's most helpful right now for you? That's it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Your need for the phrases changes|Your need for the phrases changes]]_</span>

> When we think about _samādhi_, the whole picture is important. Taking care of that, nurturing appreciation, gratitude, etc. - very significant. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Keep that willingness experimentation nurturing around|Keep that willingness, experimentation, nurturing around]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the body sensitivity, or the body feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of happiness - actually connecting with that in the body, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the body, just a vague, unremarkable sense of well-being. That connection with those kinds of feelings in the body helps the _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper|Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> If the _samādhi_ feels strong enough or there's a sense of settledness in the mind and the heart with the compassion, it can be almost, at times, as if the body has _turned into_ compassion. And you just let yourself _be_ compassion, and just radiate that out. Let everything become compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion according to categories of being or directions or just the sense of the body radiating compassion|Compassion according to categories of being, or directions, or just the sense of the body radiating compassion]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Sometimes we're more questioning, sometimes we're more allowing what needs to bubble up, and sometimes we're just developing the _samādhi_ and letting things get quiet, developing that journey into the depth, into the stillness, into the subtlety. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Encouragement|Encouragement]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past|Ripening of karma from the past]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> _Jhānas_ are a subset of _samādhi_, if you like. And _samādhi_ - it's actually quite hard to define, but it's something like a state of harmonious well-being of mind and body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Vocabulary jhanas are a subset of samadhi|Vocabulary: jhanas are a subset of samadhi]]_</span>

> We need the combination if we're really talking about big, wide, deep liberation, we need the combination of insight and _samādhi_... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas alone will not liberate totally|Jhanas alone will not liberate totally]]_</span>

> So yes, _samādhi_; yes, insight; and yes, psychological work; and _yes_, the cultivation of virtues and the beautiful qualities - _mettā,_ and generosity, and compassion, all those - those four together... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas alone will not liberate totally|Jhanas alone will not liberate totally]]_</span>

> [T]hese things are insidious, these meta-level views, and they get into the nuts and bolts of how I'm regarding _this moment_ in the meditation. This moment, "Hmm, I'm thinking." Who _cares_ if you're thinking? Does it really matter? Is the thinking making you miserable, or is it the _view_ about the thinking that's making you miserable? Is that thinking even getting in the way of _samādhi,_ and well-being, and bliss, and ecstasy? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#"No thought"|"No thought"]]_</span>

> Yes, definitely, we _do_ want to increase and develop our focus and our concentration. But we also, and oftentimes more importantly, are interested in this development of deep, profound resources, of training the perceptions (what does that mean?), the relation of that with emptiness understanding, and the development of all these lovely, lovely capacities and capabilities of attunement, sensitivity, subtlety of awareness, beauty, magic, art. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#We are interested in the development of deep profound resources|We are interested in the development of deep, profound resources]]_</span>

**[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> So often, we just go into a default breath, and the only reason it feels comfortable is just because we're used to it. At that moment, it may well _not_ be that helpful in terms of really energizing, and opening, and healing, and soothing, and moving towards _samādhi_. So we have to be, again, willing to let go of our inertia, if it's there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Also what way of breathing feels good right now|Also what way of breathing feels good right now]]_</span>

> [T]he breath needs to get subtle, the mind needs to get subtle. The journey of _samādhi_, the journey into _jhānas_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your mind to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus|Samadhi is more about open-heartedness, subtlety and refinement than focus]]_</span>

> As we go on, and get more and more, and deeper and deeper, those same qualities - sensitivity, responsivity, and willingness - start to apply to more and more aspects of the whole movement of _samādhi_ and the deepening of _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#We want a sensitivity that permeates the whole space|We want a sensitivity that permeates the whole space]]_</span>
