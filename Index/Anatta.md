#IndexEntry #Buddhology

Buddhists affirm that there is thinking and other mental events, but no thinker: if we think of the “person” as a string of beads, there is a succession of beads (momentary mental events) but no string.

What we conceptually separate as “entities” are only eddies in a constantly flowing and integrated field of events. That is, the world of multiple “real” (independent, self-contained) entities is an illusion but not what is really there—the eddies in the flow of events are not unreal but are simply not isolated entities, unconnected to the rest of the flow. The alleged discrete entities are the “discriminations” that Buddhists deny are real.

Nathan 02.09.21: It's not necessary that anatta is true. It is a lens which skillfully applied helps to a seeing that frees. (was question from Sadge: how could consciousness _not_ be myself?) => see [[Anattā.pdf]]

I form a thingness around a "thing".

Usefulness is defined in relation to dukkha (i.e. the release of it, freedom). Useful in relation to the path, to the goal.
"true/untrue" not useful
dukkha = absence of freedom

**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough freedom. There's plenty of freedom in that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#Yes it might be but we are interested in freedom rather than a certain badge|Yes, it might be, but we are interested in freedom, rather than a certain badge]]_</span>

**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen I say, "If I'm loving myself, what am I?", one level of looking at it in terms of anattā is, I am just these experiences and my relationship with them. If that becomes one of more acceptance for all that, then it's a kind of self-love, absolutely. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob Anatta practice leads to more acceptance as a kind of self-love|Rob: Anatta practice leads to more acceptance, as a kind of self-love]]_</span>

> What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our emotions; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my emotions and your emotions at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that way of looking. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other ways of seeing - emptiness, _anattā_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing|Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing]]_</span>
