**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Moving away from the kind of sense of consolation one gets from God or bodhisattva or whatever it is, away from that to _thy will_, and actually into the dark night of the soul, where one feels one isn't getting anything. There's something in that darkness, in that not getting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane|Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Is there not, in the way that you feel and relate to practice, a whole kind of mythos, a whole kind of ethos, a whole particular kind of beauty that you relate to, that speaks to you, that touches your soul? Wrapped up in that, a whole way of seeing existence? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for|It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors|Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors]]_</span>

> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues|Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues]]_</span>

> [E]ros, a desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens, deepens, leads to soulfulness, sacredness, soulmaking, sense of sacredness. Opens that out.

> [T]hey can't postpone the soul-calling to include an exploration of eros fully, richly, deeply on the path. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of delusion, the impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer. So be it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Some hear the calling to explore eros more fully|Some hear the calling to explore eros more fully]]_</span>

> [W]henever there is a sense of soulfulness, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, dimensionality, beauty, meaningfulness, in our existence, in the being, whenever there is soulmaking, sacredness in our existence, eros is involved.

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Someone with perhaps broader insight will also say something like, "Although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the self and to care for the self." Okay, so there's a psychological wisdom there that's quite important. But again, just the same regarding divinity and soul: although it's ultimately empty, it's important to respect the soul (what does that mean?), and to care for the soul (what does that mean?). &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Soul God divinity self are empty on many levels|Soul, God, divinity, self, are empty on many levels]]_</span>

> But soulmaking can also mean making soul, making something called soul.

> What kind of entity? Well, it's that entity, that aspect of _citta_, if you like, that facet of _citta_ or being, that which sees or senses in a soulmaking way. That's the entity of soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#7 Soul - either a way of looking which gives rise to soulmaking or an entity|(7) Soul - either a way of looking which gives rise to soulmaking, or an entity]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Whether eros is fertilizing for the soul, is soulmaking, is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is neither inherently positive or negative|Eros is neither inherently positive or negative]]_</span>

> [I]f we don't get in the way, if we allow soul to do what it wants to do (which is to make more soul), then self and world, as well as this other, will become soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Soul wants self other and world to become image|Soul wants self, other, and world to become image]]_</span>

> One opens one's being to those particular qualities, and the being, the soul, the energy body, the emotions start resonating with those qualities. And in so doing, we absorb those qualities. We absorb, if you like, into our life in ways that can actually then become manifest, practically manifest, really manifest, in our real, physical relationships, over time. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#It's possible to resonate with the qualities of the imaginal figure and absorb them over time|It's possible to resonate with the qualities of the imaginal figure and absorb them over time]]_</span>

> My soul is informed, has the impression, has the stamp of these deep soul-images - Coltrane, Hendrix, this friend or that friend, etc. And I treasure that. I treasure that. I _want_ to be impressed upon in that way. I want to be impressed upon. Don't we, as souls, _want_ to be impressed upon by soul, and by what is soulful? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression|Maybe the soul communicates by making an impression]]_</span>

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real]]_</span>

> [S]omething else wants to happen.

> So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "the angel out ahead." It's almost like a counterpart of ourselves, a second half of our soul, if you like, and our relationship with that through the imaginal, and the importance of that to the sense of who we are, and the direction we have in life, and our duties to that angel... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_ but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person|Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_, but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person]]_</span>

> When the inner critic is badgering us and kind of taking over and hounding us, all the power, or most of the power, has gone _there_.
