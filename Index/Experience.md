### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering|Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering]]_</span>

**[[Guided meditation - Metta to phenomena]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> We're not so interested in precision right now, just the kindness flowing, touching, surrounding, permeating experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided meditation - Metta to phenomena#Whatever there is in consciousness in the moment touching it with tenderness|Whatever there is in consciousness in the moment, touching it with tenderness]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Any situation, any experience, you can apply insight to, insight is relevant. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering|General definition of insight: that which brings lessening of suffering]]_</span>

> Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing|Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing]]_</span>

> What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Seeing things as unsatisfactory|Seeing things as unsatisfactory]]_</span>

> There's a kind of radiance that begins to come into one's experience, the more that we're able to meet it in a very direct, very simple, bare way... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight# the more we let go of papanca the more our experience begins to brighten|... the more we let go of papanca, the more our experience begins to brighten]]_</span>

> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade|When you don't stop there, experience begins to fade]]_</span>

> It's pointing to seeing this: the more I cling in any way, the more prominent experience is in consciousness. I begin to understand _how_ things arise and _how_ they fade. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Satipatthana Sutta|Satipatthana Sutta]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> You know, sometimes you want to be a bit more inner, and it's appropriate to be with one's own experience. But other times, open up. Can there be an appreciation of the beauty of what's going on here and the loveliness of everyone practising together, trying together, supporting each other, in the silence, in the schedule, and all that? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#There are many things to appreciate|There are many things to appreciate]]_</span>

> If the fear's not that strong, it's possible - just take a step back, say, "I've got two things going on," not push away the fear, but just incline towards what's pleasurable, what's enjoyable in the experience, and just lean that way. And the very enjoying of it will help the fear to just subside. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Fear can come up|Fear can come up]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]e _can_ learn to accommodate that experience of fear: the body experience, the thinking experience, and the texture of the mind experience. We learn to just bring mindfulness to it and just to be with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence|We are afraid of fear, but we can be with this, which brings confidence]]_</span>

> [T]hat body sense will reflect to me, will indicate to me when there's clinging around - holding, pushing, struggling, identifying - because some kind of contraction and tension comes into the bodily experience, even if it's very subtle. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around|The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around]]_</span>

> [S]omething comes into our experience - a thought, an emotion, a body sensation - and we regard it, without even thinking about it, oftentimes, without even realizing that we're doing it, sometimes, we regard it as 'me': "I _am_ that emotion. That's _how I am_. That's _who_ I am." Or 'mine': "That thought belongs to me. This body sensation belongs to me. This body belongs to me." The whole range of it, we identify, either identify or take ownership of. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#g Aggregates are not me not mine|g) Aggregates are not me, not mine]]_</span>

> To be enough in contact with one's experience that one trusts, "This is working for me, and I know it is, and it's okay. And I trust that." That's really important, to trust one's own practice, what one sees and feels for oneself in one's own practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You know what's good for you just go with that|You know what's good for you, just go with that]]_</span>

> So it's a different question than, "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a noise?" It's not going there, to that question. It's avoiding that question. We're talking about experience and understanding experience in the light of suffering arising or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that|Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards that experience itself, whatever the prominent experience right now, or whatever any experience in consciousness right now, just bathing it with kindness, with tenderness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Bathe that experience in kindness and compassion|Bathe that experience in kindness and compassion]]_</span>

> As if you're opening the doors of awareness very wide, very spacious, to welcome. Complete, radical acceptance of the experience, whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Bathing holding total welcoming|Bathing, holding, total welcoming]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> We can, in our practice, direct this stream, at times, when we feel a stream of loving-kindness and compassion, actually direct it towards experience, whatever the experience is, and actually bathe that experience in loving-kindness and compassion, _or_ compassion, or both, or a mixture, or whatever it is. We can _hold_ it in compassion, _hold_ it in love, or _let_ it be held in that water of love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Recap guided meditation directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience|Recap guided meditation: directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience]]_</span>

> One works in the practice to make it completely genuine, really, really welcoming this experience so that the arising of any experience is completely welcomed, completely held in that love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Emphasizing acceptance not so much precision and clarity|Emphasizing acceptance, not so much precision and clarity]]_</span>

> The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it. To the degree that love comes into that relationship, that peace comes into that relationship, the suffering goes out of experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it|The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it]]_</span>

> The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any experience is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of insight. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it|The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it]]_</span>

> [T]he more welcoming there is, basically the less aversion, the less pushing away and pulling towards (we say "less pushing and pulling"; that's less grasping), and what we notice is that the world, the world of experience, appears less. And if there's really very little grasping, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about grasping that's actually building experience. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The less grasping the less appears at all|The less grasping, the less appears at all]]_</span>

> And then if you really want to turn your consciousness inside out, grasping builds experience. What builds grasping? Experience. I can't grasp without anything to grasp at. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#I can't grasp without anything to grasp at|I can't grasp without anything to grasp at]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> In this practice, the more that we can actually encourage and dwell in that spaciousness, where whatever suffering there is or whatever suffering could possibly arise in the universe, it actually is effortlessly held. And we can begin to get glimpses of that experience and then actually nurture it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The more we encourage this spaciousness the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it|The more we encourage this spaciousness, the more suffering can be effortlessly held in it]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Do I dare to ask, "Why?" Why do I want to live life to the full? Why? Why do I want to savour the moment, savour the experience, the taste, the breeze on the cheek? Why? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#What does it mean to "live life to the full"|What does it mean to "live life to the full"?]]_</span>

> And the therapist saying, "You've got to hang in there. It's a dark night. You can't run away from it. It's the truth coming up." Or is it the fact that psychological ideas, certain psychological ideas, are stimulating certain experiences? That the experience, rather than being real or true, is actually _caused_ by certain ideas? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#What comes up in psychotherapy is it really true stuff|What comes up in psychotherapy, is it really true stuff?]]_</span>

> Carl Jung said, "Ideas are not made by persons, but persons by ideas." We don't see how powerful ideas are, because they shape the way we see ourselves and the world and existence, and then that's the existence that we feel ourselves move in. They conjure our experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#Unquestioned ideas operate in us and they will keep delivering the same limited range of experiences unless they are questioned|Unquestioned ideas operate in us, and they will keep delivering the same limited range of experiences, unless they are questioned]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated. And I start to see, again: dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my experience, my perception, and what appears to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear|Even the pleasant vedana become neutral, and even those neutral sensations disappear]]_</span>

> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality?
