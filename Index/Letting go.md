### Quotes
**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Seeing things as unsatisfactory|Seeing things as unsatisfactory]]_</span>

> It's "not me, not mine." And in that, there's a letting go, a very beautiful letting go. It's not at all about disconnection, dissociation, or numbing out, or anything like that. It's practicing a mode of seeing, a certain lens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Seeing things as not-self|Seeing things as not-self]]_</span>

> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade|When you don't stop there, experience begins to fade]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> You don't let go of one rung until you've grabbed hold of the other one. There's something that's helping our letting go, that's moving us on. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#"Skilful attachment"|"Skilful attachment"]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the spaciousness, the letting go, is very significant. You can be letting go of a lot of aversion in that. Aversion has a lot to do with tiredness. When there's aversion around, it's just very tiring. So letting go, being spacious, actually allows that to just let go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it|Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade|When we let go, we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> '[C]linging,' and all the subtleties and the beauties of working with that in practice: letting go of clinging, moving up and down the spectrum of clinging, and seeing what it does to the fabrication of the perception of self, other, world, time, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It also fits with emptiness teachings|It also fits with emptiness teachings]]_</span>

> [T]hese teachings are integrated into the usual Dharma teachings about craving and letting go and releasing _dukkha_, and the much deeper teachings about dependent arising and emptiness, and that forms a non-realist basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations|The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations]]_</span>

> Energization through the whole space with the in-breath; a kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath. Qualities of energy that fill the whole space with the in-and the out-breaths. So this is what we want to tune to, open to, really feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#A kind of relaxation easing letting go with the out-breath|A kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath]]_</span>
