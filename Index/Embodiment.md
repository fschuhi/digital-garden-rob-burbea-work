### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of .. the vast unknown of death. So in a way can we contemplate the infinite every day, can we contemplate death every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards equanimity, moving towards freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death|This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death]]_</span>

**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> They are also subject not just to death but to the uncertainty and change that is, in a way, woven into the fabric of the moment of our lives. They don't know what the next moment will bring, what will happen to the mind, to the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#They are also subject to the uncertainties of live|They are also subject to the uncertainties of live]]_</span>

**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> We tend to see barriers and walls and discrete entities. When we look deeper, there are no barriers. It's a very fluid, amorphous, non-separate thing, this body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#We breathe the same air molecules as everyone before us|We breathe the same air molecules as everyone before us]]_</span>

> But the space is quite important. Just a space radiating compassion. Sometimes it can feel like you're just resting in that space, and there's very little doing, very little phrases. It's just sort of not doing much; it's just a space of compassion. That can be very helpful. Sometimes, again to emphasize, to be as much as possible in the body with it. So it's almost like the body becomes compassion. It's just radiating out compassion. You've become compassion... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#A space radiating compassion|A space radiating compassion]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So joy, happiness actually does have a vibration in the body, has a resonance there, reverberation. And if we can tune into that and just hold that in our attentiveness... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Attention to joy itself feeds joy|Attention to joy itself feeds joy]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> It's embodying that strength of commitment. That will find its way into the being. And in time, staying more with the phrases, staying more with the object. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#So strength is also an aspect of samadhi|So strength is also an aspect of samadhi]]_</span>

> [M]ake the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger. As I said at least once in the instructions, the Buddha says "sensitive to the whole body." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 2 tightness|ad 2. tightness]]_</span>

> When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the body. So part of the art of meditation, part of the art of deepening _samādhi_, is to have this kind of background awareness of breadth of the body awareness, and be sensitive to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 2 tightness|ad 2. tightness]]_</span>

> So any kind of pleasantness, sense of well-being, sense of comfort, pleasure in the body, physical, you want to encourage. It's part of the practice, and you want to kind of mix it in with what's going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Non-entanglement|Non-entanglement]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And this is partly why we keep encouraging this sensitivity that's developed in your practice, particularly sensitivity to the body, and just actually _allowing_ the _mettā_ to take these subtly different flavours, at times. Sometimes, when it has that feeling, to go through that, and really just allowing that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's more a constellation of feelings|It's more a constellation of feelings]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the body sensitivity, or the body feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of happiness - actually connecting with that in the body, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the body, just a vague, unremarkable sense of well-being. That connection with those kinds of feelings in the body helps the _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper|Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper]]_</span>

> So there's the body, the thoughts, and the texture, the climate of the mind, and correspondingly, the aversion to that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around|Inner texture of the mind shrinks when there's fear around]]_</span>

> [W]e _can_ learn to accommodate that experience of fear: the body experience, the thinking experience, and the texture of the mind experience. We learn to just bring mindfulness to it and just to be with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence|We are afraid of fear, but we can be with this, which brings confidence]]_</span>

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> [T]hat body sense will reflect to me, will indicate to me when there's clinging around - holding, pushing, struggling, identifying - because some kind of contraction and tension comes into the bodily experience, even if it's very subtle. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around|The body sense will indicate when there's clinging around]]_</span>

> [S]omething comes into our experience - a thought, an emotion, a body sensation - and we regard it, without even thinking about it, oftentimes, without even realizing that we're doing it, sometimes, we regard it as 'me': "I _am_ that emotion. That's _how I am_. That's _who_ I am." Or 'mine': "That thought belongs to me. This body sensation belongs to me. This body belongs to me." The whole range of it, we identify, either identify or take ownership of. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#g Aggregates are not me not mine|g) Aggregates are not me, not mine]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|Balance this with a healing energy (2) giving out]]_</span>

> [A] little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the happiness makes compassion enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing. And we need to kind of feel that energy in the body, that energy going, or even just imagine it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#You can play with this it's not a static balance|You can play with this, it's not a static balance]]_</span>

> The body is vulnerable. We are vulnerable to death. Reflecting, we are one in that. We share that. There's a oneness there. We are one in our uncertainty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Incline the mind towards oneness|Incline the mind towards oneness]]_</span>

> [T]his body is coming - the elements in it come from elements that were generated in massive stars, and then those stars exploded and flung out these elements into space. And all the elements that make up our fingernails and our cornea and whatever it is - everyone in this room, the elements that made that were born in the same star. I think it's amazing! &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#The inifinite nature of the self|The inifinite nature of the self]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Holding it all in compassion. Allowing it to be held in compassion. Realizing, reflecting: nothing, absolutely nothing is outside this web, this infinite web. Sustaining us, nourishing us, giving to us. And that we too are part of that web. Sensitive to suffering. Letting it be held in compassion. And just allowing a sense of space to open up. And allowing the body to just radiate out compassion in space, filling space, all space, all directions. Filling it with that tenderness, with that healing. Holding all things in compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to all animals and plant life|Compassion to all animals and plant life]]_</span>

> If the _samādhi_ feels strong enough or there's a sense of settledness in the mind and the heart with the compassion, it can be almost, at times, as if the body has _turned into_ compassion. And you just let yourself _be_ compassion, and just radiate that out. Let everything become compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion according to categories of being or directions or just the sense of the body radiating compassion|Compassion according to categories of being, or directions, or just the sense of the body radiating compassion]]_</span>
