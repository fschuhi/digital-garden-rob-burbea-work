> I think it's really the whole range of that. But certainly the allowing the spaciousness, the letting go, is very significant. You can be letting go of a lot of aversion in that. Aversion has a lot to do with tiredness. When there's aversion around, it's just very tiring. So letting go, being spacious, actually allows that to just let go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it|Be willing to experiment with the whole range of it]]_</span>
