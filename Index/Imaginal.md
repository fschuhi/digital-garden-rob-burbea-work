<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [T]here are some who can't wait. They have to include and learn as they go along, through different ways of looking, different practices, trial and error (with the help, hopefully, of the teachers), but to discern between these different movements: what's _papañca_? What's imaginal practice? It's possible. It's absolutely possible. But in a way, parallel tracks are running concurrently. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#There are some who cannot wait|There are some who cannot wait]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Eros always invokes, is involved with or involves, and stimulates the imaginal and the soulmaking. I'll explain more about this later. That process of soulmaking and the imaginal is, in itself, rich, and so eros brings more richness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#"Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid"|"Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid"]]_</span>

> I would say this body of material needs listening to, studying, practising with - all that material around the emptiness, but certainly around the imaginal material, in series. In other words, it adds up. In that way, only then can a person kind of see and understand what is meant in these teachings. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#What soul-styles can we approach this material with|What soul-styles can we approach this material with]]_</span>

> "Notice the love with the imaginal figures." This is really important. Imaginal figures always involve love. Sometimes it's really not obvious at all. Sometimes it can _look_ like the opposite, but there is love there. And there are many different kinds of love, many flavours, characters, expressions of love. This is to be noticed in imaginal practice. And it's both ways. The love is both ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is already in imaginal practice because imaginal figures always involve love|Eros is already in imaginal practice, because imaginal figures always involve love]]_</span>

> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2019 Four Circles, Four Parables of Stone and Light]]</span>
> [W]hen we talk about the _imaginal_ Middle Way, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of the self, a dissolving, a disappearing, a fading of self or other objects of the imagination. To be an object of the imagination, it must be formed in some way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#We are free to entertain any sense of self|We are free to entertain any sense of self]]_</span>

> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that|Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that]]_</span>

> So as the imaginal grows, the _papañca_ diminishes. As the _papañca_ grows, the imaginal diminishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Story wounded blackbird|Story: wounded blackbird]]_</span>

> Sometimes you get an image which is not so much a narrative image as much as it has a kind of backstory. It has a kind of imaginal background. So one understands, almost actually implicitly - not like watching a series of events, but one understands implicitly the story or the narrative... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Image Queen trailing blood|Image: Queen, trailing blood]]_</span>

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real]]_</span>

> So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "the angel out ahead." It's almost like a counterpart of ourselves, a second half of our soul, if you like, and our relationship with that through the imaginal, and the importance of that to the sense of who we are, and the direction we have in life, and our duties to that angel... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_ but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person|Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_, but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person]]_</span>

> [I]mages, imaginal beings, angels that sometimes are kind of in conflict with each other, or at least move, pull us, draw us, beckon us in different directions; ask of us impossibly divergent things. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Polytheistic psyche|Polytheistic psyche]]_</span>

> [W]e're dancing on the breadth of this boulevard of the imaginal Middle Way with respect to reification, how much, how little at different times. And sometimes, or with some people at some times, it's important that they view or that they are encouraged to view: "Do you realize you're more _really_ that, you're more _really_ or more _primarily_ angel than you are what you appear to be in the conventional sense, in the conventional view?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#3 over- or under-reification of the sense of self|(3) over- or under-reification of the sense of self]]_</span>

> Soul wants the whole palette to be available for its art.

> They don't need you and you don't need them, because there's nothing in the way a person is living and the choices that a person is making that needs the help or presence of the angels, of the imaginal figures. There's nothing really on the line, so to speak. There isn't really a [[Soul|soul-stretch]]. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Or they don't need you and you don't need them|Or they don't need you and you don't need them]]_</span>

> They're not living and choosing in their life in ways that really stretch their [[soul]] or that open them to kind of soul-risks, if we might use that phrase. There's nothing really on the line. And they might be stretched in all kinds of ways - might be very busy, might be stretched doing something very helpful in the world, whatever, but it's not actually a soul-stretch, and there's no real risk there. And maybe it's that the [[Daimon|angels]], the [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], the daimons, don't need and won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch - stretch themselves, stretch their lives, stretch their soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Daimons won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch 🟢|Daimons won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch 🟢]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> You're doing this in dyadic relationship with an image. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the body and make gestures and vocalize to the [[Daimon|angel]], to your angel who is your dyad partner, to the image there, to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the [[blessing]] and just the mystery of that communication from the angel, in your imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Rather than actual person dyad partner is intrapsychic image|Rather than actual person, dyad partner is intrapsychic image]]_</span>

> But actually to hold a fully authentic imaginal image, and be in relation to that image, and dance at the same time, in a way that both the dancing and the image, the soulfulness of both and the sensing with soul of both, is kind of mutually enhanced and mutually woven together and implicated, that's quite hard for most people - even most people who have a practice of dance, etc., and of the imaginal.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult|Holding an imaginal image and dancing at the same time is difficult]]_</span>
