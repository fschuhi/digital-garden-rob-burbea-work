There is not such a thing as "anicca", but there's an anicca _view_

### Quotes
**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The [sense of self](app://obsidian.md/The%20Self) is fixed, lasting, permanent, steady. And I look inside, and all I see is impermanence, so therefore no fixed self. It's not really real in the way that I thought it was. All I can say there _is_ is a continuum of mind moments, a continuum of experiences through time. So impermanence can lead to the others like that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#The resulting letting go is not disconnection and it can lead to an understanding of anatta|The resulting letting go is not disconnection, and it can lead to an understanding of anatta]]_</span>

> But there are ways of understanding anattā that go even beyond the notion of impermanence, a whole other depth. If that's accessible, then that's great; if it's not, it's fine. There's enough freedom. There's plenty of freedom in that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#Yes it might be but we are interested in freedom rather than a certain badge|Yes, it might be, but we are interested in freedom, rather than a certain badge]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So most obvious example would be impermanence. It's just true for everyone and all things. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Universal insights pertain to all beings and all things|Universal insights pertain to all beings and all things]]_</span>

> Just going through and just focusing on impermanence so that the fact of impermanence begins to impress itself deeply, deeply on the consciousness. And we begin more and more to be able to live that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#"Take up the theme" seeing impermanence in visual forms emotions body sensations sounds|"Take up the theme": seeing impermanence in visual forms, emotions, body sensations, sounds]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So at times, we can be in a mode of practice where we're just letting everything come up and everything go. We're just into the impermanence of it, and that's totally fine. And other times, we're very interested in cultivating the joy, and we're deliberately in a mode of nourishing something, nurturing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#But we can also cultivate joy|But we can also cultivate joy]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the nature, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _anicca_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one's doing the _mettā_, can either kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life|a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life]]_</span>

> I find nothing but perceptions, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this impermanence can lead to an understanding of emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world|Those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And if in our life our compassion is restricted to when we _feel_ it, that's too limited. Sometimes in our life we _don't_ feel it, but we act still. We _do_, we _act_ with compassion. We embody that intention. We cannot feel it all the time because feelings are impermanent... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Like metta compassion is not just a feeling|Like metta, compassion is not just a feeling]]_</span>
