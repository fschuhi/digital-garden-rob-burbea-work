### Quotes
**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But mostly it's actually just a little drop, and then one goes out into that infinite web of conditions in the life. Maybe it's just a seed. It meets another condition, then it begins to sprout. Maybe it sprouts a little here, and then it gets watered. Maybe it meets the wrong conditions and it just gets covered over, you know? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Maybe it's just a seed|Maybe it's just a seed]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> "I won't put the pole here; I'll keep going, keep the questioning alive," until one has totally understood this dependent arising and how anything at all - no matter how beautiful, how subtle, how refined, how seemingly ultimate - comes to be. And that doesn't mean dismissing everything as just conditions, and it's just all irrelevant. It doesn't mean that at all, because one also opens to the Unconditioned and the beauty of what that means as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened|To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> To realize the actual limits of one's actions and just to see: we are limited. Or even in other contexts, you have to see that here, one may be giving service or acting compassionately or trying to alleviate the suffering, and it's only one strand in a web of conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it|Compassion needs wisdom and faith in it]]_</span>

> That's what wisdom or insight or _paññā_ means: we're understanding the causes and conditions that lead to suffering. And out of that very understanding is born compassion. That very understanding will bring with it compassion. So one could never go anywhere near loving-kindness practice or compassion practice, and just the deepening of the insight will bring compassion naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the causes and conditions and _understanding_ that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering|Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering]]_</span>

> What's at the root of suffering? We're feeding suffering with the causes and conditions and through not understanding. And it's that seeing of the commonality that brings a lot of compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#We begin to see the commonality we are feeding suffering through not understanding|We begin to see the commonality: we are feeding suffering through not understanding]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Axiomatic: there's nothing beyond this. What do you mean by _this_? What do you mean? Poke, question. What do you mean by _this_? Do you mean matter? Or do you mean appearances? Big difference in what is meant. If you mean matter, what is it that you mean by matter? {quote If you mean appearances, there's nothing beyond appearances, again, what exactly do you mean? And do you understand, through meditation, the dependent arising and the dependent fading and cessation of all appearances, so that there can be a beyond this, a beyond appearances? This is available in meditation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"|"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"?]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> What does it mean to say that appearances appear, but they are empty? They're dependent arisings. They're fabrications. They're illusory. They do not exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory]]_</span>

> This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a dependent arising. It's a fabricated illusion. It is not a thing in itself, without the mind clinging at it or to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory]]_</span>

> Actually, even this teaching of dependent origination, all those links, we start to understand, in a way, that that very teaching starts to melt itself. Those links, they melt, they overlap, they blur, they fade. We see they're not real things either. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The links of dependent origination are not real either|The links of dependent origination are not real either]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors|Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors]]_</span>

> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues|Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation|3. Opening a direction of investigation]]_</span>

> [T]hese teachings are integrated into the usual Dharma teachings about craving and letting go and releasing _dukkha_, and the much deeper teachings about dependent arising and emptiness, and that forms a non-realist basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations|The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations]]_</span>
