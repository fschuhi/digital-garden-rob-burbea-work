### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering|Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering]]_</span>

**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Dharma is one of these words that can have a lot of different meanings. I think what it means here is what we were doing this morning: experiences, objects of awareness, things, stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is; a moment of some object of awareness is a dharma. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us whatever it is|Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is]]_</span>

> And there's complete welcoming, complete acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or awareness practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Emphasis was on complete acceptance|Emphasis was on complete acceptance]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [M]ake the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger. As I said at least once in the instructions, the Buddha says "sensitive to the whole body." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|ad 1. tightness]]_</span>

> When we get too tight, what happens? We actually feel it in the body. So part of the art of meditation, part of the art of deepening _samādhi_, is to have this kind of background awareness of breadth of the body awareness, and be sensitive to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|ad 1. tightness]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the nature, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _anicca_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one's doing the _mettā_, can either kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life|a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life]]_</span>

> And putting the awareness, just gently keep putting it other places - belly, heart centre, etc. And the more you do that with that sensitivity, the more the energy, the more the awareness kind of rests there, takes its centre there. And then it can radiate from there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head|Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head]]_</span>

**[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Not a self - I don't ever encounter a self. What I encounter is moments of mind with something happening in that mind moment, moments of awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#2 Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments|(2) Compassion to self is compassion to mind moments]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Just opening up the awareness to the huge stream of generosity, of care that we have received from our parents. Allowing the heart to open, too, to their pain, their suffering, their confusion. Wherever they are now, "May they be free from suffering. May they be at peace." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to the parents|Compassion to the parents]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> As if you're opening the doors of awareness very wide, very spacious, to welcome. Complete, radical acceptance of the experience, whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Bathing holding total welcoming|Bathing, holding, total welcoming]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [A]s practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our awareness to be able to notice mind states. If we're calling eros a mind state or a state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the energy body is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of mind, and what we might call the space of mind, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they're underneath or alongside thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind|We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Buddha-nature, _dharmakāya_, emptiness, the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic awareness that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the emptiness of all things, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects). In that sense, it's non-dual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty; this knowing awareness is empty in itself - but the knowing and_ the appearances _and_ their emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Buddha-nature according to Shentong|Buddha-nature according to Shentong]]_</span>

> World Soul - there's a kind of intelligence or divine activity that's operating in and through and as Buddha-nature, as well as that awareness and its inseparability from emptiness, from appearances, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#The dharmakaya can act in the world|The dharmakaya can act in the world]]_</span>

**[[Daimon, Refracted]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Four Circles, Four Parables of Stone and Light]]</span>
> [H]aving a sense of body, how the body feels, how the energy body feels, its presence right now, its material presence, its energetic presence and feel, but also of your self. There's a self sitting here, so to speak, and that self has a narrative, and that kind of can be included, so to speak, in the larger scope or background of the awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Let the sense of self including your narratives be there too|Let the sense of self (including your narratives) be there too]]_</span>

**[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Meet every number. Be there. Sense it, alive. If you're drowsy, make those numbers brighter. Make them louder. Keep opening up the awareness - the whole space, larger than the body. Keep opening it, again and again and again. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#Meet every number|Meet every number]]_</span>

> [M]oving slowly around enables you to kind of keep that basic, whole-body awareness, that basic mindfulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#Slow down to retain whole-body awareness|Slow down, to retain whole-body awareness]]_</span>

> It's part of the whole kind of energetic awareness we want to gradually cultivate, this bubble of resource. So find that pace where actually that's what you're doing when you're moving around - you've got some sense of the whole body, and the energy of the whole body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#Slow down to retain whole-body awareness|Slow down, to retain whole-body awareness]]_</span>

**[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> What it means is, these days, liberation needs to include a certain depth and breadth, and capacity, and sophistication, and sensitivity with regard to what we might call psychological awareness of self and other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#Emotional discernment and emotional capacity in awakening and healing|Emotional discernment and emotional capacity in awakening and healing]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [I]f I want a liberation that actually does have sensitivity in it, and attunement, and relational skill, and psychological awareness, and want to understand about emptiness as something very different, to do with ways of looking and fabrication, then I'm going to have to think about _jhānas_ in a very different way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice|There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice]]_</span>

> Yes, definitely, we _do_ want to increase and develop our focus and our concentration. But we also, and oftentimes more importantly, are interested in this development of deep, profound resources, of training the perceptions (what does that mean?), the relation of that with emptiness understanding, and the development of all these lovely, lovely capacities and capabilities of attunement, sensitivity, subtlety of awareness, beauty, magic, art. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#We are interested in the development of deep profound resources|We are interested in the development of deep, profound resources]]_</span>

**[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [T]he awareness inhabits equally, homogenously, the whole space, and even a little bit bigger. So the whole thing is integrated and homogenized. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Homogeneity of experience but also of awareness|Homogeneity, of experience but also of awareness]]_</span>

> So the awareness will keep shrinking. It will shrink a thousand times. And just keep opening it out to just a little bit bigger than the physical body space, and fill that with alive awareness, presence. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#We are interested in the felt sense not so much the image of the physical form|We are interested in the felt sense, not so much the image of the physical form]]_</span>

> So in the whole space, attuned, alive, filled with awareness; the longest breath. Just how does it feel, the expansion and the contraction with the breath? Really tuning to that and feeling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#The whole space is expanding on the in-breath contracting on the out-breath|The whole space is expanding on the in-breath, contracting on the out-breath]]_</span>

**[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> When we get tired, the mind shrinks. It's actually what we do when we curl up and go to sleep: the mind pulls in on itself, in a way. And so, opening up that awareness, opening your eyes, open up the awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#i Open awareness wider than the energy body|(i) Open awareness wider than the energy body]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> We're talking about an energy body sense - expanding, moving, and feeling, sensing and imagining not just the space of the energy body in its usual size, but also the extended sense of the energy in the room, and how that's connected with and impacted by and filled by the energy of your body movements. It's more than just the space of awareness. We're talking about energy body sensitivity here... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 1#The kinaesthetic sense of energy fills the whole space|The kinaesthetic sense of energy fills the whole space]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of [[anxiety]], or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the [[awareness]]. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There might be self-consciousness arising|There might be self-consciousness arising]]_</span>
