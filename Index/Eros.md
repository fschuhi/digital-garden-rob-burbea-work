> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors|Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors]]_</span>

> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues|Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues]]_</span>

> [E]ros, a desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens, deepens, leads to soulfulness, sacredness, soulmaking, sense of sacredness. Opens that out. A desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens out, deepens, enriches, complicates also, our sense of sacredness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Provision definition of "eros"|Provision definition of "eros"]]_</span>

> [T]hey can't postpone the soul-calling to include an exploration of eros fully, richly, deeply on the path. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of delusion, the impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer.

> Why introduce this other word, eros, when we have lots of words, as we elaborated in part one of the first talk? Why bother? Well, that's a good question. It's really a good question.

> Setting it apart allows us to investigate it, to become interested in it, and then we can see how it works. What is this thing? How does it work? And where does it lead, this thing that we're going to call eros? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros is connected to divinity cosmopoesis soulmaking to be covered later|Eros is connected to divinity, cosmopoesis, soulmaking (to be covered later)]]_</span>

> Sacredness never resides in this or that object or thing; we sacralize. We make something or other sacred through our relationship with it. So there's the possibility of sacralizing sexuality, rather than just viewing eros or sexuality as a defilement, or as leading inevitably to defilement. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#2 Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself|2. Opening to the recognition of the sacredness of eros itself]]_</span>

> I cannot reduce a romantic love relationship or a marriage to _mettā_ . There's something more involved, or that needs to be involved. Part of that 'more' is what we're going to call eros, what we're calling eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present|All this is not really adequately addressed in the Dharma at present]]_</span>

> [W]henever there is a sense of soulfulness, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, dimensionality, beauty, meaningfulness, in our existence, in the being, whenever there is soulmaking, sacredness in our existence, eros is involved. Eros is involved whenever there is soulmaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros involves energy embodiment the imaginal and logos|Eros involves energy, embodiment, the imaginal, and logos]]_</span>

> [P]eople differ in the flavours or the characters, if you like, of the ways eros, or libido, or if we say life force, expresses in their lives. They differ in the flavours, the characters, the ways eros expresses in their lives. The fire, if you like, if eros is a kind of fire, the fire of eros looks and burns differently. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Different people different characters also how eros expresses in their lives|Different people, different characters, also how eros expresses in their lives]]_</span>

> [E]ros is more than _mettā_ ; it's not the same as craving; it's not even just wholesome desire, _hitacchanda,_ or desire that leads to less suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology|We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros involves and leads to soulmaking, and widening of the senses of sacredness beyond just the 'is-ness' of things, and even beyond the transcendence that's possible for us, for consciousness, transcendence in oneness or the Unfabricated. And opening up sacredness wider than a kind of universal sacredness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Recap Why eros why this delineation|Recap: Why eros, why this delineation?]]_</span>

> [B]ecause of this contextualization and relationship, and the place that something like eros takes within a larger set and framework of ideas and experiences, etc., it means that we're going to have to move back and forth between a sort of small vision, big vision, and tie things together. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is tied in with other notions concepts and experiences|Eros is tied in with other notions, concepts, and experiences]]_</span>

> 'Erotic object' means what eros is in relationship to, or the 'beloved,' if you like, if you want that more poetic language. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is a kind of desire for more contact|Eros is a kind of desire for more contact]]_</span>

> [E]ros is the wanting of more contact, more connection, more touch, more knowing, more experience of, to experience more of, to have more intimacy, more penetration, more opening to the erotic object or beloved. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros goes together with Pothos|Eros goes together with Pothos]]_</span>

> Eros always goes along with - I think he's another god called Pothos. Pothos is another Greek word. And Pothos is the infinite desire or the desire for the infinite. It's the 'more.' &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros goes together with Pothos|Eros goes together with Pothos]]_</span>

> I would say eros is a part or an element of life force, or, better, a certain direction or manifestation of life force. As beings, we have a certain amount of life force at any time, or just in our existence, and eros would be one directionality and one manifestation of the way that life force manifests. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros is a concept both a bigger and a smaller than others|Eros is a concept both a bigger and a smaller than others]]_</span>

> [A]s practitioners, we need to develop our sensitivity and the subtlety of our awareness to be able to notice mind states. If we're calling eros a mind state or a state of being, to develop the sensitivity to that without relying on the clues and cues of thoughts. Seeing how the energy body is affected, developing the sensitivity to that, to the textures of mind, and what we might call the space of mind, the subtle mental movements that are there even when there is no thought, or they're underneath or alongside thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind|We need to develop the sensitivity to the texture of mind states and the space of mind]]_</span>

> There's an element in eros, if you like, that preserves the otherness, and therefore the tension of the two and the tension of the attraction. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Eros involves a tension of the attraction towards otherness|Eros involves a tension of the attraction towards otherness]]_</span>

> Eros always invokes, is involved with or involves, and stimulates the imaginal and the soulmaking. I'll explain more about this later. That process of soulmaking and the imaginal is, in itself, rich, and so eros brings more richness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#"Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid"|"Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid"]]_</span>

> And so there's a kind of self-feeding, self-generating, ongoing fertilization, mutual fertilization of eros, psyche, logos; mutual widening, deepening, enriching, complicating, adding dimensionality, etc., that goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Mutual fertilization of erso psyche logos|Mutual fertilization of erso, psyche, logos]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [T]hese words (opening to, service, surrender) either lead to eros, they deepen the eros, or they already imply that eros is there in the relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is already in imaginal practice because imaginal figures always involve love|Eros is already in imaginal practice, because imaginal figures always involve love]]_</span>

> And if it's not clear by now (hopefully it is), we can have eros and an erotic connection with someone with or without sex or sexual contact. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Sex is possible with and without love care eros|Sex is possible with and without love, care, eros]]_</span>

> [E]ros leads, brings, stimulates, opens a perception of - more and more so, in fact, as it goes on - a perception of the beauty and the divinity. More and more, as I said, this grows, the divinity of the object, of the erotic object. Eros opens the perception of beauty and divinity, and we can't help but love what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#But it's not possible to have eros without love|But it's not possible to have eros without love]]_</span>

> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other]]_</span>

> There's this mutual insemination, mutual fertilization, growth, expansion, deepening, widening, complexifying, complicating, enrichening of eros-psyche-logos. They all help each other, if you like. They're all involved with and involve each other. That's the eros-psyche-logos dynamic. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other]]_</span>

> But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception, in a certain sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it|Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception, it liberates it]]_</span>

> Whether eros is fertilizing for the soul, is soulmaking, is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is neither inherently positive or negative|Eros is neither inherently positive or negative]]_</span>

> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that|Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that]]_</span>
