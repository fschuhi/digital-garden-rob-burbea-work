### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Mind always has some mind state. So with [mindfulness](app://obsidian.md/mindfulness), there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love|But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Put that on as a lens, a way of seeing, as a practice. So this is moving beyond what we might call "simple mindfulness" or "simple presence or being," and actually deliberately taking up a certain mode of seeing, a certain way of looking at experience, for a period of time... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing|Another way to consolidate the insight is to use it as a mode of seeing]]_</span>

> Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference|Impermanence is an obvious fact, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Mindfulness, when there's mindfulness, attentiveness, presence, with curiosity and the curiosity of investigation, that can be there, and a kind of energy with that, that we're injecting some energy into that. That brings joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Mindfulness i e the its energy brings joy|Mindfulness (i.e. the its energy) brings joy]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [M]ake the mindfulness a bit bigger, meaning make the range of the awareness a bit bigger. As I said at least once in the instructions, the Buddha says "sensitive to the whole body." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 1 tightness|ad 1. tightness]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]e _can_ learn to accommodate that experience of fear: the body experience, the thinking experience, and the texture of the mind experience. We learn to just bring mindfulness to it and just to be with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence|We are afraid of fear, but we can be with this, which brings confidence]]_</span>

> What's almost always lacking with fear is confidence. We don't feel confident that we can actually be with the fear and accommodate it, and be okay with it. With practice, bringing mindfulness to all of it, we just see: it's just that, and it's accommodatable. Confidence comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We are afraid of fear but we can be with this which brings confidence|We are afraid of fear, but we can be with this, which brings confidence]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Rather than seeing meditation and mindfulness, then, as being part of a thrust of understanding reality, seeing a deeper level of reality, in this case reality is given with common sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#Mindfulness as a coping strategy of the assumed real common sense existential predicament|Mindfulness as a coping strategy of the (assumed real, common sense) existential predicament]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality? Or is that just a certain level of less fabrication? So I keep this framework of ways of looking and fabrication, and I just see. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Bare sensations etc is not ultimate reality|Bare sensations etc. is not ultimate reality]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [T]he mode of mind, the gear, the circuitry, if you like, should revert to a kind of more mindful stance, a kind of neutral gear, which will be more easeful of the suffering that's inherent in discrepancy-based processing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#The "Mode of mind" is supposed revert to a more mindful stance|The "Mode of mind" is supposed revert to a more mindful stance]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were travelled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one insight, one opening led to another, etc., all based on what we might call the 'phenomenological approach,' which is how I would base my approach to the Dharma. It's very, very simple, starting with very, very simple practices, including the ideas of mindfulness, but not based on the usual assumptions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#There is a natural evolution of the material|There is a natural evolution of the material]]_</span>

**[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [M]oving slowly around enables you to kind of keep that basic, whole-body awareness, that basic mindfulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#Slow down to retain whole-body awareness|Slow down, to retain whole-body awareness]]_</span>

**[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> They're little seeds. And then without wisdom and mindfulness, those seeds become huge, huge trees, forests, jungles - jungles, better. Partly what allows them to become a jungle, those seeds, is _believing_ them: believing what they tell us... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Hindrances proliferating manifestations of kilesa seeds|Hindrances proliferating manifestations of kilesa seeds]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of [[anxiety]], or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the [[awareness]]. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There might be self-consciousness arising|There might be self-consciousness arising]]_</span>
