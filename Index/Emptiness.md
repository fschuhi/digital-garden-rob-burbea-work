### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Seeing emptiness leads to love and compassion, because it's kind of done away with the reality of separation, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom|The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom]]_</span>

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs|Rob: attention is kind of like prongs]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade|When you don't stop there, experience begins to fade]]_</span>

> It's pointing to seeing this: the more I cling in any way, the more prominent experience is in consciousness. I begin to understand _how_ things arise and _how_ they fade. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Satipatthana Sutta|Satipatthana Sutta]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> I find nothing but perceptions, and they are inseparable, and in a way, it's seeing - it's a way that this impermanence can lead to an understanding of emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Those perceptions are not separate from the universe from the world|Those perceptions are not separate from the universe, from the world]]_</span>

> Without belief in the self, there can't really be fear. Where is the fear going to take root? It's around self. When we begin to understand, deeply and in the heart, this emptiness of self, we realize there's actually nothing real here to protect, to defend, to worry about, and fear gets released at a very deep level in our lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#We want to understand something about what the self is and how it is in a way that brings freedom into our life|We want to understand something about what the self is, and how it is, in a way that brings freedom into our life]]_</span>

> So you can play with kind of going into that emptiness, but not too much, so you still keep them around a bit. You kind of see that they're empty, but you also don't go too far into that - you can kind of pull them back and forth on this sliding scale of emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone|(2) You can play with how formed you make someone]]_</span>

> So you kind of make them somewhat empty, but not completely empty, so you've still got a sense of somewhere you can direct the _mettā_ towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone|(2) You can play with how formed you make someone]]_</span>

> What certain situations need is very relative, conventional language. We need to talk about our emotions; we need to express what we feel to each other; we need to respect that. I need to respect my emotions and your emotions at that level. So in that moment, that's what's helpful, that way of looking. But I'm saying a mature practice is able to move between picking that up, putting it down, picking up other ways of seeing - emptiness, _anattā_, etc. - and putting them down, not getting stuck in one or the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing|Maturity in practice comes from being able to move between different ways of seeing]]_</span>

> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade|When we let go, we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> To have a perception, I need the rest of the universe to perceive. So we can talk about emptiness. We can also say emptiness is fullness: _this_ is _full_ of everything. This being, these beings, this self is _full_ of the universe. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Perception is a double-sided feature|Perception is a double-sided feature]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> To begin to see into relationship is to begin to see into emptiness. And to begin to see into emptiness is to begin to see into freedom. That's where the deepest freedom is. It's right there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Through loving-kindness and compassion practices we see into the relationship that we have with experience i e into emptiness|Through loving-kindness and compassion practices, we see into the relationship that we have with experience, i.e. into emptiness]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> There are many ways of seeing emptiness. But the point of a practice like what we've introduced this week is that one sees it over and over. One does this over and over until, more and more, the coin drops. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual|Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual]]_</span>

> And just to remember that emptiness is one tool. It's a tool we pick up for freedom from suffering, for the release from suffering. So compassion is another. They're both tools. And there are times when they come together in one kind of flow. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual|Contemplation of emptiness is very gradual]]_</span>

> Now, ultimately speaking, you _could_ say nothing happened that day. Nothing happened _really_. But unless we can pick that up and really see it that way, unless our understanding of emptiness is so evolved that that really means something for us, in a way that it liberates compassion, then you put down the emptiness as a tool. Forget about it. It's just words. It's just cleverness. And you pick up the tool of compassion, and you relate in terms of beings suffering and my response to their suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Story 9 11 was not "nothing happened"|Story: 9/11 was not "nothing happened"]]_</span>

> It's all empty. At one level, nothing happened. At another level, I'm right there. That's what allows a bodhisattva to be a bodhisattva, is that the emptiness and the compassion are together. Without that, forget about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because they're holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all|The bodhisattva can make such a huge aspiration because they're holding the compassion with the emptiness of it all]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Axiomatic: there's nothing beyond this. What do you mean by _this_? What do you mean? Poke, question. What do you mean by _this_? Do you mean matter? Or do you mean appearances? Big difference in what is meant. If you mean matter, what is it that you mean by matter? {quote If you mean appearances, there's nothing beyond appearances, again, what exactly do you mean? And do you understand, through meditation, the dependent arising and the dependent fading and cessation of all appearances, so that there can be a beyond this, a beyond appearances? This is available in meditation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"|"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"?]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> More craving, more solid and more dense and more real, if you like, the world becomes, and more oppressive. Let go of craving, let go at a deeper level, start to see these dependencies, start to see objects, too, begin to fade out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Less craving less self gets fabricated - - fading|Less craving, less self gets fabricated - - fading]]_</span>

> They fade in the sense that they blur, they dissolve. They fade into white light or into blackness or whatever. They disappear. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Appearences fade because I'm releasing the clinging|Appearences fade because I'm releasing the clinging]]_</span>

> We need to see this dependent fabrication and dependent fading many, many times, because it's such a deep level of delusion that's entrenched there for us to believe in the reality of things... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#We need to see the fading many times|We need to see the fading many times]]_</span>

> I cannot have a full leaning on the insight of emptiness at the same time as I have the appearance of an object. It will fade to the degree that I lean on, that I allow the fullness of that knowing of its emptiness into the way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Only Buddhas can contemplate emptiness and appearance at the same time|Only Buddhas can contemplate emptiness and appearance at the same time]]_</span>

> Actually, even this teaching of dependent origination, all those links, we start to understand, in a way, that that very teaching starts to melt itself. Those links, they melt, they overlap, they blur, they fade. We see they're not real things either. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The links of dependent origination are not real either|The links of dependent origination are not real either]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [N]either that chocolate cake investigation or the tea investigation, nor the deep investigation into dependent arising and emptiness that I explained, will be enough for understanding and opening out and giving nourishment and life, and structure and vision, and opening doors in the realm, in the direction, of the soul-passions or the subtle movements of eros. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Nourishment life structure vision opening doors|Nourishment, life, structure, vision, opening doors]]_</span>

> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues|Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues]]_</span>

> I would say this body of material needs listening to, studying, practising with - all that material around the emptiness, but certainly around the imaginal material, in series.

> Buddha-nature, _dharmakāya_, emptiness, the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic awareness that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the emptiness of all things, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects). In that sense, it's non-dual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty; this knowing awareness is empty in itself - but the knowing and_ the appearances _and_ their emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Buddha-nature according to Shentong|Buddha-nature according to Shentong]]_</span>

> [W]hen we talk about the _imaginal_ Middle Way, we're not talking about simply a dissolution, a melting of the self, a dissolving, a disappearing, a fading of self or other objects of the imagination.

It's a face of the divine. It's an expression of the divine, which is different than an [[emptiness]]. An emptiness is not a theophany.
