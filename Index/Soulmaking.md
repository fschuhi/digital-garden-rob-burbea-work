> [E]ros, a desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens, deepens, leads to soulfulness, sacredness, soulmaking, sense of sacredness. Opens that out. A desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens out, deepens, enriches, complicates also, our sense of sacredness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Provision definition of "eros"|Provision definition of "eros"]]_</span>

> [W]henever there is a sense of soulfulness, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, dimensionality, beauty, meaningfulness, in our existence, in the being, whenever there is soulmaking, sacredness in our existence, eros is involved.

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros involves and leads to soulmaking, and widening of the senses of sacredness beyond just the 'is-ness' of things, and even beyond the transcendence that's possible for us, for consciousness, transcendence in oneness or the Unfabricated. And opening up sacredness wider than a kind of universal sacredness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Recap Why eros why this delineation|Recap: Why eros, why this delineation?]]_</span>

> Eros always invokes, is involved with or involves, and stimulates the imaginal and the soulmaking. I'll explain more about this later. That process of soulmaking and the imaginal is, in itself, rich, and so eros brings more richness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#"Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid"|"Dont' proceed until all things have been made liquid"]]_</span>

> [C]raving is a kind of desire that does _not_ lead to soulmaking. Actually, it leads to a kind of contraction.

> Whether eros is fertilizing for the soul, is soulmaking, is enriching, is beautiful, is opening and opening up the sense of existence or not, and therefore desirable or not, is really dependent on what happens in relationship to that whole dynamic, or how that whole dynamic is able to unfold. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros is neither inherently positive or negative|Eros is neither inherently positive or negative]]_</span>

**[[Daimon, Refracted]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Four Circles, Four Parables of Stone and Light]]</span>
> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real]]_</span>

> In a way, I'm offering these particular teachings now, offering them so that there's the possibility that you can practise, and practise in a way that you don't end up regretting, that you don't end up regretting not supporting yourself fully, or allowing yourself or enabling yourself fully to move in the direction or be moved in the direction of what _you_ want with respect to [[Soulmaking|Soulmaking Dharma]], and also what you want with respect to [[soul]] in life, the expression and the living of soul in life, _your_ soul in _your_ life.

> Beautiful as the [[experience]] of that week can be, or some of the experiences on that week can be, and touching, might it be that something more steady - courses, classes, groups, etc. - actually provide maybe not _more_ support, but a different kind of support, and a necessary kind of support for making a real, more long-term difference in terms of [[soul]] and soulmaking and what soul needs? That's something to think about. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#Maybe steady courses classes groups can provide a different kind of support|Maybe steady courses, classes, groups can provide a different kind of support]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] ('fabrication' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the understanding it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in 'soulmaking.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word 'soul,' or have a sense of soul, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A teacher said "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"|A teacher said: "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"]]_</span>
