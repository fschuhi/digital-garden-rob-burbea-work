> So there's the particular, unique way these ten _Sefirot_ manifest and express through me. So something that can start as an apparently impersonal image, or even sound like it, actually can be, by including the narrative and the particulars and the uniqueness, can be rendered more unique, retain its particularities, retain its personhood and uniqueness to self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#My particularities were retained in the meditation not just a universal kind of manifestation of God|My particularities were retained in the meditation, not just a universal kind of manifestation of God]]_</span>
