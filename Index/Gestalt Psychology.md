### Quotes
**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**

> Now, okay, so here's a certain personality, a certain kind of style of expression. Certainly it's not to imply that the only way to stand firm is in a quiet and serene way. I don't want to imply that at all. But if this is the kind of iconic moment we're drawing on or we're focusing on for this part of this exercise, then that's actually part of the [[image]], that it is quiet and serene. So maybe you can get a sense of that, of what would it be to sense into that whole, the whole [[Gestalt Psychology|gestalt]], the whole configuration of that whole moment, that whole image, that whole time, that icon, that iconic moment, and then see how that wants to be mirrored or refracted or expressed with the body [[Embodiment|movement, gesture, voice]], or what wants to manifest or express in response to that or from that as a seed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Embodying reflecting refracting|Embodying, reflecting, refracting]]_</span>
