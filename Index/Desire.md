> [I]s it even possible to create a large form (say a long piece of music, or a novel, or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time) without craving, clinging, attachment, desire? Or training - the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Art sexuality without desire|Art, sexuality without desire?]]_</span>

> There's a constrainment of the idea of what's allowed in terms of desire, and also of fantasy and image of what awakening looks like, what kind of desires and involvements an awakened person has, and therefore what we're moving towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed|Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed]]_</span>

> And, conversely, the investigation of my soul-passions, and my desire in relation to that, and that kind of eros, whether it's really strong or much more subtle, won't be - it will actually tell me _something_ about dependent origination and emptiness, _something_, but not enough for the full monty there, the full depth of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Each of the three are different doors directions avenues|Each of the three are different doors, directions, avenues]]_</span>

> [E]ros, a desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens, deepens, leads to soulfulness, sacredness, soulmaking, sense of sacredness. Opens that out. A desire, a movement of the psyche, of the being, that opens out, deepens, enriches, complicates also, our sense of sacredness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Provision definition of "eros"|Provision definition of "eros"]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And some people don't seem to have an interest or a desire, there's not much libido, if you like, towards awakening in general. They don't talk about it. They don't listen to talks that mention it. When it's talked about, they'll just lose interest. They'll actually say - I've heard many people say to me, "I'm just not interested." So that's interesting, too, to me. Why? What's going on there? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Why seem others not really interested in awakening|Why seem others not really interested in awakening?]]_</span>

> So the desire is always there. The flame of desire never goes out, because there's always more. There's always a greater expansion. There's always more depth and diversity and range to what awakening is and can be. There are always new horizons of awakening opening up. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening|High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening]]_</span>

> Practising in that way, actually respecting the desire and, if you like, empowering it - without necessarily acting on it; we're talking about a meditation here - practising this way leads to an experience where the desire does not bring _dukkha._ Quite the opposite: it brings a kind of fulfilment and opening of the being. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Practice allowing dukkha without acting on it|Practice: allowing dukkha, without acting on it]]_</span>

> I'm just here as a temporary vehicle for a desire that has never begun nor ceased stretching out towards the beloved, so my specific love stories become just some personified renditions of a myth essentially unspoken and inexhaustible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Perceiving oneself as a temporary vehicle for an eternal love|Perceiving oneself as a temporary vehicle for an eternal love]]_</span>

> [E]ros is more than _mettā_ ; it's not the same as craving; it's not even just wholesome desire, _hitacchanda,_ or desire that leads to less suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology|We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology]]_</span>
