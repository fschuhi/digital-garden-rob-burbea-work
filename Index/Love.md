### Quotes
**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So with these three characteristics, one of the indicators that they're working properly is that they bring [[Awakening|freedom]] and love, and not a sense of coldness and disconnection or fear, as I said before.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#The emptiness that opens up from "not me not mine" is inbued with love|The emptiness that opens up from "not me, not mine" is inbued with love]]_</span>

**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But sometimes, a different sense of it is visible, which is that we're actually getting out of the way. We're doing less and less. And in that doing less and less, we are building less and less, building less and less barriers. And there's the love there... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#There is cultivation but also that we're actually getting out of the way|There is cultivation, but also that we're actually getting out of the way]]_</span>

> And there's complete welcoming, complete acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or awareness practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Emphasis was on complete acceptance|Emphasis was on complete acceptance]]_</span>

> There's nowhere outside of acceptance. There's nowhere outside of love. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-acceptance, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the love, the space of love, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the kindness, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Relaxing back into a space of metta|Relaxing back into a space of metta]]_</span>

> Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#But don't be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind|But don't be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind]]_</span>

> Seeing emptiness leads to love and compassion, because it's kind of done away with the reality of separation, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom|The indicator for emptiness is love and freedom]]_</span>

> [W]hen I say, "If I'm loving myself, what am I?", one level of looking at it in terms of anattā is, I am just these experiences and my relationship with them. If that becomes one of more acceptance for all that, then it's a kind of self-love, absolutely. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob Anatta practice leads to more acceptance as a kind of self-love|Rob: Anatta practice leads to more acceptance, as a kind of self-love]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> There's absolutely love in it. In that state, there's a kind of non-separation. We're not building a sense of self and other, a sense of separation, by getting involved in this tussle, in this push and pull. In the non-separation, there's love, effortlessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#There is wonder beauty love and juiciness in equanimity practice|There is wonder, beauty, love and juiciness in equanimity practice]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> The deeper we go into this - and it's a very gradual thing, it's a very gradual process - the deeper we go into it, the more freedom is liberated, the more joy, the more peace, the more love and compassion are liberated. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#This far from being nihilistic quite the opposite|This far from being nihilistic, quite the opposite]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all Dharma joy, spiritual joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself|Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [L]ove for the self, love for others, love for nature, for all things, for all beings.

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Just the fact of your being means that you deserve it. And to give the love to ourselves is actually a gift to others, begins to become a foundation from which we can give to others, and actually, an indispensable foundation for making that a steady and a deep giving that lasts. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#To give love to ourselves becomes a foundation from which we can give to others|To give love to ourselves becomes a foundation from which we can give to others]]_</span>

> So _mettā_ in its aspiration is: it doesn't matter what you do, what you give me back, what you say, whether you're grateful, what you've done, whether I like you - none of that. It's unconditional. But usually, there are strings and conditions attached to our love, and it's actually attached love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Near enemy of metta is attached love|Near enemy of metta is attached love]]_</span>

> So part of what 'practise' means is playing with ways of looking, shaking things up, saying, "Let me look at this another way. Let me practise looking at this another way," until that other way, which brings freedom with it, which brings love with it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe|This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe]]_</span>

> We need to [huffing noises] huff and puff and blow the house _up_, actually. We need to construct it. And we can actually see this going on. And then we see what that does to the love, see what it does to the expansiveness of the love. It basically shrinks. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#We can see what that does to the expansiveness to love|We can see what that does to the expansiveness to love]]_</span>

> Walking, walking meditation, and the foot touches the earth, and actually, there can be a kiss there. There can be love, somehow felt, tenderness, beauty felt, between foot and earth. This is available to us, something we can explore, something we can play with. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Explore a tenderness of touch for ourselves|Explore a tenderness of touch for ourselves]]_</span>

> Possibility for a wider sense of mystery of being to come in, and in that, a wider sense of love. And one sees: it's life going on. It's life expressing itself. And children moving, and old people, and interactions with shopkeepers, and business transactions, and - it's all just expressing itself. And dogs, and whatever it is - life expressing itself. And there is an opening of the heart to that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Play with dropping what I want|Play with dropping what I want]]_</span>

> And it's almost as if the silence takes on a fabric of itself, a meaning of itself. Almost a mystical sense of silence can open up. That can have everything to do with love. It's almost as if the silence holds love in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Silence takes on a fabric a meaning of itself|Silence takes on a fabric, a meaning of itself]]_</span>

> And it seems at first that there was a person _here_ and a person _there_, and the love is moving towards them. It can deepen. And it's almost like the sense of the person begins to _blur_ a bit. And there is just the sense of two hearts, and a flow, a radiation, between the two hearts. And even that can deepen. And can become, at times, a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. There's just really one heart, one consciousness, imbued with love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#There can be a sense of flow between the two hearts a communion of hearts|There can be a sense of flow between the two hearts, a communion of hearts]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the clinging brings release from suffering, and that brings love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release|Alternative: practice ways of looking that bring release]]_</span>

> [L]ove and fear have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the Buddha offered the _mettā_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is an aversion that blocks love|Fear is an aversion that blocks love]]_</span>

> It shouldn't be depressing, so only to use this if it feels like it's actually unlocking some love and compassion in the heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life|a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life]]_</span>

> And you can toy with this playing of perception. Something comes: this moment, death, and vastness. And again, instead of unlocking fear, sometimes it can unlock more love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Put the moment of perception into context of the unknown|Put the moment of perception into context of the unknown]]_</span>

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if suffering can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of freedom, and love comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled|The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**

This is to be noticed in imaginal practice. And it's both ways.
