### Quotes
**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> [A]bsolutely everything that we take for granted, is actually built and fabricated by my relationship to it, by the way I'm looking at it. Not to understand that, the Buddha called that the fundamental delusion, the fundamental ignorance that human beings have, or that consciousnesses have. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Everything is fabricated|Everything is fabricated]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The very nature of consciousness itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - 'fabricating' is the Buddha's word - fabricating an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience|There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>

> What does it mean to say that appearances appear, but they are empty? They're dependent arisings. They're fabrications. They're illusory. They do not exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory]]_</span>

> This self-sense that seems so real, this object-sense that seems so real, this thing before me, this thing in my mind, this emotion, whatever it is, seems so real - it's a dependent arising. It's a fabricated illusion. It is not a thing in itself, without the mind clinging at it or to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory]]_</span>

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty|Not just that is not me, but it is empty]]_</span>

> [L]anguage is difficult, but eventually there can be a complete unfabricating. Nothing is fabricated at all: no subject, no object, no time (past, future or present), no space. Something that language cannot even approach except by negatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#There can be a complete unfabrication|There can be a complete unfabrication]]_</span>

> Everyone seems to talk as if these things are real - bare sensations, or if I'm in a certain culture, the atomic process of mind moments and experiences. Is that the ultimate reality? Or is that just a certain level of less fabrication? So I keep this framework of ways of looking and fabrication, and I just see. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Bare sensations etc is not ultimate reality|Bare sensations etc. is not ultimate reality]]_</span>

> We need to see this dependent fabrication and dependent fading many, many times, because it's such a deep level of delusion that's entrenched there for us to believe in the reality of things... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#We need to see the fading many times|We need to see the fading many times]]_</span>

> I can fabricate all these different directions, and many more - actually infinite possibilities of fabrication, many, many more than that, in different directions and different degrees, and the whole art of fabrication, if you like, and that spectrum opens up for me, and the directions of artful fabrication open up as practice, as play. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The jhanas as deep states of unfabricating|The jhanas as deep states of unfabricating]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation|3. Opening a direction of investigation]]_</span>

> '[C]linging,' and all the subtleties and the beauties of working with that in practice: letting go of clinging, moving up and down the spectrum of clinging, and seeing what it does to the fabrication of the perception of self, other, world, time, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It also fits with emptiness teachings|It also fits with emptiness teachings]]_</span>

> One of the immense strengths of the Buddha's teaching and Dharma teaching is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become ways of looking. That's what these concepts are; they become ways of looking. But they serve to simplify. So Dharma concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they fabricate less. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca|Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> So there's a spectrum of fabrication, and different ways of looking fabricate more or less, all the way to extremely gross and solid and oppressive, to much, much less fabricated, less fabricated, less fabricated, etc., down into not fabricating at all. What's fabricated there, as I said, is _dukkha_, is dis-ease and suffering, but also the sense of self, the sense of object, the sense of world, the sense of time - all of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#3 Fabrication|(3) Fabrication]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [I]f I want a liberation that actually does have sensitivity in it, and attunement, and relational skill, and psychological awareness, and want to understand about emptiness as something very different, to do with ways of looking and fabrication, then I'm going to have to think about _jhānas_ in a very different way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice|There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice]]_</span>

> There's no privileged way of looking. There are just ways of looking. Things are empty. Insight is the practice of ways of looking that liberate, and ways of looking that fabricate less. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Start with the goal malleability of perception|Start with the goal: malleability of perception]]_</span>

**[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Without me _doing_ something, usually unconsciously, it cannot arise as that emotion. It cannot get fabricated. It cannot get constructed. So in the Buddha's words, we "see a hindrance as a hindrance,"^[Cf. the Buddha's statement at DN 22: "One dwells seeing phenomena as phenomena in terms of the five hindrances" _(dhammesu dhammānupassī viharati pañcasu nīvaraṇesu)_] and not necessarily as an emotion. We recognize what's there. It's a 'fabrication,' or in other language, it's actually 'empty.' &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication|Over time it becomes almost undeniable that an emotion is an fabrication]]_</span>

> [T]he view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhānas_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one|I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I'm not parking in either one]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> Oftentimes it's the 'making' that people don't relate to, the word 'making.' Of course, if you understand the whole track of exploration of [[ways of looking]] and [[fabrication]] ('fabrication' is just another word for 'making'), and how that deepens, and how it opens out, and the understanding it opens out, then the word 'making' is almost an indispensable word in 'soulmaking.' But for a lot of people, it's very puzzling, because you'd usually think of the word 'soul,' or have a sense of soul, or use that in a very reified way: it wouldn't be something that we _make_. It would be something that _is_, or we discover, or that just is a level of being or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#A teacher said "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"|A teacher said: "I don't really relate to the word 'soul'"]]_</span>
