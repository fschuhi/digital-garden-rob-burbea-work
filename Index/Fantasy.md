### Quotes
**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Is there not, in the way that you feel and relate to practice, a whole kind of mythos, a whole kind of ethos, a whole particular kind of beauty that you relate to, that speaks to you, that touches your soul? Wrapped up in that, a whole way of seeing existence? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for|It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> There's a constrainment of the idea of what's allowed in terms of desire, and also of fantasy and image of what awakening looks like, what kind of desires and involvements an awakened person has, and therefore what we're moving towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed|Constraints on the kinds of desire or fantasies that are allowed]]_</span>

> There is the necessity of fantasy, the inevitability of fantasy when we care deeply, when we love, when we're attracted. The problem is when the fantasy is unconscious or regarded as a problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#The problem is when fantasy is regarded as a problem|The problem is when fantasy is regarded as a problem]]_</span>

> Can I have a conceptual framework, can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a fantasy that, actually, romantic love becomes part of the path, and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot nourish those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap|When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about, the whole structure will snap]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> There can be and hopefully is an erotic view, an erotic connection, with the path, and with the idea, or the vision, the fantasy, the notion, the concept of awakening. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything|You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> So images, fantasies come in, they pervade, they mix with, they saturate our perception of everything - of self, of other, of world, of being, of path, etc. They operate in our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world|The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world]]_</span>

> Where there is love, meaningfulness, importance, aliveness, _there_ there is image and fantasy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world|The imaginal and images also relate to how we perceive the world]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> We need to recognize both the general fact that it's operating, and also the particular ways that it's operating for us, that fantasy and image operate for us, and the kinds and directions in which fantasy and image operate, and mix in with our life, and impel our life. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#In any Dharma fantasy and image is already involved|In any Dharma, fantasy and image is already involved]]_</span>

**[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> You need a fantasy of yourself as a practitioner - you know, a juicy, soulmaking, beautiful image fantasy of yourself, something that's operating in the background, a fantasy of the tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#You need a fantasy of the retreat|You need a fantasy of the retreat]]_</span>

> Fantasy of the whole tradition; it's all part of it. That's part of your happiness and nourishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#You need a fantasy of the retreat|You need a fantasy of the retreat]]_</span>

> '[F]antasy' as opposed to 'image.' They're almost subliminal. They're just kind of really nourishing and supporting, lubricating our whole sense of what we're doing, giving moisture there, giving beauty and depth. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#There fantasies operate in the background|There fantasies operate in the background]]_</span>
