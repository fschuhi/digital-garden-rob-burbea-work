> So there's the particular, unique way these ten _Sefirot_ manifest and express through me. So something that can start as an apparently impersonal image, or even sound like it, actually can be, by including the narrative and the particulars and the uniqueness, can be rendered more unique, retain its particularities, retain its personhood and uniqueness to self. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#My particularities were retained in the meditation not just a universal kind of manifestation of God|My particularities were retained in the meditation, not just a universal kind of manifestation of God]]_</span>

> [H]aving a sense of body, how the body feels, how the energy body feels, its presence right now, its material presence, its energetic presence and feel, but also of your self. There's a self sitting here, so to speak, and that self has a narrative, and that kind of can be included, so to speak, in the larger scope or background of the awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Let the sense of self including your narratives be there too|Let the sense of self (including your narratives) be there too]]_</span>
