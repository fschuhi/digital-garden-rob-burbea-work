### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Dharma is one of these words that can have a lot of different meanings. I think what it means here is what we were doing this morning: experiences, objects of awareness, things, stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is; a moment of some object of awareness is a dharma. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us whatever it is|Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all Dharma joy, spiritual joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself|Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well. The actions in our life will flow back into the heart and the consciousness when we come back to sit. Most things in Dharma work both ways in terms of causality. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Action i e putting ourselves in situations of service|Action, i.e. putting ourselves in situations of service]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And these become very charged concepts: 'what is,' 'things as they are.' But again, that's never, never, never the goal of the path. It's a beautiful way of practising. It's a beautiful way of being - _cannot_ be the goal of the path. The goal of the path is an understanding, a very deep understanding, that brings freedom with it. It brings freedom. It's something gone beyond this 'what is' and these notions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#In mindfulness practice the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"|In mindfulness practice, the assumption is often that mindfulness is neutral - "things as they are"]]_</span>

> There's something in opening to a state like that - whatever it is, infinite consciousness pervading the universe - these are all quite related states, very, very, potentially incredibly transforming for the long term. People often fall into one of two extremes with them. One is to reify them and think they've arrived somewhere, and actually stop short their questioning in the path. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#You don't want to rush through those beautiful states but also not misunderstand them as ultimate|You don't want to rush through those beautiful states, but also not misunderstand them as ultimate]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So a talk, or a Dharma teaching, or whatever it is, an insight, is actually just a seed. And then it needs to meet a lot of other conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#The talk is landing in a lot of different mind states|The talk is landing in a lot of different mind states]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> What I really want to explore is the assumptions underneath how we think of and conceive the Dharma, practice, the path, etc. The way we think and conceive of the Dharma, and the assumptions _underneath_ how we're thinking of and conceiving of practice, path, Dharma, are not often at the forefront of our minds. They're sort of somewhere at the back, and the assumptions are often _really_ buried. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#This talk is about the assumptions underneath ho we're conceiving of the Dharma|This talk is about the assumptions underneath ho we're conceiving of the Dharma]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> Can I have a conceptual framework, can I form, can I open to a conceptual framework and a fantasy that, actually, romantic love becomes part of the path, and not just in those kind of simplistic terms? The concepts, if I try and stretch too small a set of concepts over the range of things that we deeply care about, the whole structure will snap. It's not adequate. It cannot support it. It cannot nourish those areas that we really care about, _if_ we really care about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about the whole structure will snap|When I stretch a limited conceptual framework over things I care deeply about, the whole structure will snap]]_</span>

> We want _more_ than ease and peace - certainly, probably certainly, than either the kind of ease and peace that is just a matter of stress reduction, or coping with pain, painful sensations. Even we want more than the ease and peace of the most profound kind, the most comprehensive kind. So look. See. Even within the Dharma, isn't it more than ease you want? Isn't it more than _that_ that you're looking for? Yes, there's ease. There's the ease of suffering that we're after. And what? If you love the Dharma, it's not just that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Human beings want more than easeand peace|Human beings want more than easeand peace]]_</span>

> [T]hey can't postpone the soul-calling to include an exploration of eros fully, richly, deeply on the path. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of delusion, the impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer. So be it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Some hear the calling to explore eros more fully|Some hear the calling to explore eros more fully]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [S]ome people (and again, I would also include myself) sort of at the edge of Dharma would even conceive of an endlessly expanding - not quite receding, but endlessly expanding - notion of awakening. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening|High bar in Theravada; for Rob it's an endlessly expanding notion of awakening]]_</span>

> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation|3. Opening a direction of investigation]]_</span>

> There can be and hopefully is an erotic view, an erotic connection, with the path, and with the idea, or the vision, the fantasy, the notion, the concept of awakening. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything|You can have an erotic connection with everything and anything]]_</span>

> [T]hese teachings are integrated into the usual Dharma teachings about craving and letting go and releasing _dukkha_, and the much deeper teachings about dependent arising and emptiness, and that forms a non-realist basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations|The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations]]_</span>

> One of the immense strengths of the Buddha's teaching and Dharma teaching is that he kind of gives us a set of concepts, and in a way, they become ways of looking. That's what these concepts are; they become ways of looking. But they serve to simplify. So Dharma concepts serve to simplify, simplify because they fabricate less. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca|Dharma concepts aim towards less papanca]]_</span>

> [W]e need a slightly more elaborate Dharma psychology because of the different kinds of sacredness and the different realms of experience which are slightly more involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology|We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology]]_</span>

> The doors were presented one after another. The consequences, the avenues, were travelled in a kind of logical or inevitable order - one insight, one opening led to another, etc., all based on what we might call the 'phenomenological approach,' which is how I would base my approach to the Dharma. It's very, very simple, starting with very, very simple practices, including the ideas of mindfulness, but not based on the usual assumptions. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#There is a natural evolution of the material|There is a natural evolution of the material]]_</span>

> And I also insist that this is not a bad thing. Not at all a bad thing. It's inevitable, and it's important, and it may well, I would say, be necessary. It's certainly necessary to galvanize in relation to practice and Dharma, and to be inspired in life, and to have meaningfulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#In any Dharma fantasy and image is already involved|In any Dharma, fantasy and image is already involved]]_</span>
