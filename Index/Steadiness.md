### Quotes
**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So the mind, the heart, the being staying steady, staying balanced, unshakeable, whatever happens, whatever's going on, whatever is coming to the senses. Sometimes to ask ourselves: how much does my mind state depend on what's going on? This happens or that happens; how much does the mind state wobble with that? A steadiness with it is what equanimity is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Equanimity is steadiness in the face of all conditions|Equanimity is steadiness in the face of all conditions]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And that calmness, like when the water is calm in a pond or a lake or something, I can actually pick up even more subtle levels of craving. So then I can feel that, very subtle, and release those, and even more calm. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The calmer I get the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up|The calmer I get, the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up]]_</span>
