> So Corbin, of course, talked a lot about - actually I, before, talked about - "the angel out ahead." It's almost like a counterpart of ourselves, a second half of our soul, if you like, and our relationship with that through the imaginal, and the importance of that to the sense of who we are, and the direction we have in life, and our duties to that angel... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_ but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person|Corbin's "person archetype is not something in _me_, but this earthly person gravitating towards this spiritual person]]_</span>

> "If a celestial person, if an angel, is represented by a particular gesture or word or phase of the ritual, then to observe these is already to exist in the manner of that transcendent person." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Human beings can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence|Human beings can be led to typify and exemplify in themselves a celestial existence]]_</span>

> Self is dimensionalized, divinized, recognized as sacred, or allowed to flower in a sense of sacredness. Self as theophany, or as potential theophany. Eternality - so this angel out ahead, or this, what he's calling in this case the celestial person, is eternal. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Self is dimensionalized divinized recognized as sacred|Self is dimensionalized, divinized, recognized as sacred]]_</span>

> [I]mages, imaginal beings, angels that sometimes are kind of in conflict with each other, or at least move, pull us, draw us, beckon us in different directions; ask of us impossibly divergent things. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Polytheistic psyche|Polytheistic psyche]]_</span>

> [W]e're dancing on the breadth of this boulevard of the imaginal Middle Way with respect to reification, how much, how little at different times. And sometimes, or with some people at some times, it's important that they view or that they are encouraged to view: "Do you realize you're more _really_ that, you're more _really_ or more _primarily_ angel than you are what you appear to be in the conventional sense, in the conventional view?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#3 over- or under-reification of the sense of self|(3) over- or under-reification of the sense of self]]_</span>

> [T]here is the possibility of sensing the self with soul, sensing the self as a temporal emanation of what is timeless, the angel, a theophany. We hold it lightly, and in that light holding of it, as I said, it can have enormous power, bear enormous fruit, something very, very beautiful. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Our culture doesn't really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being|Our culture doesn't really support that view of the dimensionality of the human being]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> A second thing that it means is that the movement, gesture, and voice of oneself or of another, in their everyday, ordinary usages - just the voice speaking, or just having a conversation, or exclaiming something, or the hand moving as it speaks, or whatever it is - those ordinary usages of movement, of gesture, of voice can be sensed with soul, can be sensed, therefore, as angelic, as refracting the [[Daimon|angel]], the daimon.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 2#2 Ordinary usages of movement gesture voice can be sensed with soul|(2) Ordinary usages of movement/gesture/voice can be sensed with soul]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> This angel, in the mystery of their being, in the mystery of this angelic constellation, this angelic relationship, this angel is both other and self. But it's [[Divinity|theophany]]. It's a face of the divine. It's an expression of the divine, which is different than an [[emptiness]]. An emptiness is not a theophany. An emptiness is usually construed as an essence, usually construed as a transcendent essence beyond all attributes. A theophany is a face, ... a being in itself...... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#If we do not aim for Aspect 4 we might see the face of the divine Aspect 5|If we do not aim for Aspect 4 we might see the face of the divine (Aspect 5)]]_</span>

> We have to delimit; we're not just open for any old ideas about angels and all that business. That's why I said the words, the concepts, are pointing us in a direction, and pointing us along a road, but that road is infinite. It has boundaries. It's not like _anything_ can fall under the scope of that road... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#We have to delimit|We have to delimit]]_</span>

> They don't need you and you don't need them, because there's nothing in the way a person is living and the choices that a person is making that needs the help or presence of the angels, of the imaginal figures. There's nothing really on the line, so to speak. There isn't really a [[Soul|soul-stretch]]. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Or they don't need you and you don't need them|Or they don't need you and you don't need them]]_</span>

> They're not living and choosing in their life in ways that really stretch their [[soul]] or that open them to kind of soul-risks, if we might use that phrase. There's nothing really on the line. And they might be stretched in all kinds of ways - might be very busy, might be stretched doing something very helpful in the world, whatever, but it's not actually a soul-stretch, and there's no real risk there. And maybe it's that the [[Daimon|angels]], the [[Imaginal|imaginal figures]], the daimons, don't need and won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch - stretch themselves, stretch their lives, stretch their soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Daimons won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch 🟢|Daimons won't choose someone who is not willing to stretch 🟢]]_</span>

> There's a mystery in the kind of impossibility of finally dividing them up as one or two, this being that I'm encountering, this being that I'm sensing with soul. ... So that infinite echoing and mirroring is of the angel into this person's life, and this person's life and this person's being as the infinite echoing and mirroring of the angel, and the angel also a mirror and an echo of the being, in a kind of two-way, back-and-forth echoing and mirroring each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Words like 'angel' 'soul' 'image' imply unfathomability|Words like 'angel', 'soul', 'image' imply unfathomability]]_</span>

> The being of the angel, the dimension of the being of the angel, is not of space. It's not located inside me, or next to me, or behind me, or wherever, above me, below me, but nor is it located in time. It's refracted ... into space and time. And there's a sense, too, of participation ... or reconnecting with my sense of participating in something, and the mystery of that word. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#Angel is not of space or time|Angel is not of space or time]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> You're doing this in dyadic relationship with an image. Same thing though: you take your turn to move the body and make gestures and vocalize to the [[Daimon|angel]], to your angel who is your dyad partner, to the image there, to the [[Imaginal|imaginal figure]]. And then you receive, in your imagination, the movements, the gestures, the vocalizations, the [[blessing]] and just the mystery of that communication from the angel, in your imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#Rather than actual person dyad partner is intrapsychic image|Rather than actual person, dyad partner is intrapsychic image]]_</span>

> [W]e're focusing on the time prior to that, on Abraham and his openness of [[soul]], his soul-antennae, his receptivity, his hospitality to the angels... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#It's about the moments prior to the scene in the Rublev's image|It's about the moments prior to the scene in the Rublev's image]]_</span>
