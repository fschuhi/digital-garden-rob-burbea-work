### Quotes
**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> You can actually be in the practice, doing the _mettā_ or the compassion - bring this in. Think about Big Bangs, and think about stardust and the way the breath is permeable. Bring it in, and see what happens. It needs practice, but it will lead to love and compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Interpenetrating|Interpenetrating]]_</span>

**[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Bring some energy. See them, bright, bright like the sun. White, golden light. Bright, shining, with the breath, with the whole body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#3 The visual sense of the numbers|(3) The visual sense of the numbers]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Does it make a difference if I keep the breath or my primary object? Some people say, "Absolutely. You can't let go of the primary object. If you're doing _jhāna_, you need to keep the breath. You need to keep the primary object." We'll see, actually, that you can do it both ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Can I develop a nose for what's primary what's secondary|Can I develop a nose for what's primary, what's secondary?]]_</span>

**[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> So in the whole space, attuned, alive, filled with awareness; the longest breath. Just how does it feel, the expansion and the contraction with the breath? Really tuning to that and feeling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#The whole space is expanding on the in-breath contracting on the out-breath|The whole space is expanding on the in-breath, contracting on the out-breath]]_</span>

> Can you feel it right to the edges of the space, the whole body? Can you tune to, even enjoy, open to, this experience, the sense, the feeling of energization with the in-breath? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#The in-breath energizes the whole space|The in-breath energizes the whole space]]_</span>

> Energization through the whole space with the in-breath; a kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath. Qualities of energy that fill the whole space with the in-and the out-breaths. So this is what we want to tune to, open to, really feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#A kind of relaxation easing letting go with the out-breath|A kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath]]_</span>

> Can you imagine the feeling, a kinaesthetic imagination, the breath coming in at the solar plexus, and currents going simultaneously in opposite directions, up the body and down the body? Just play. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Maybe there is a double current of energy going up and down|Maybe there is a double current of energy, going up and down]]_</span>

> So is it keeping this really longest breath? Is it a very short breath? Is it somewhere in between? Is it a kind of very, very subtle breath, or a grosser breath? Smooth or coarse? What feels best right now? What way of breathing feels best right now? You have to experiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#What length of breath feels best right now|What length of breath feels best right now?]]_</span>

> So often, we just go into a default breath, and the only reason it feels comfortable is just because we're used to it. At that moment, it may well _not_ be that helpful in terms of really energizing, and opening, and healing, and soothing, and moving towards _samādhi_. So we have to be, again, willing to let go of our inertia, if it's there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Also what way of breathing feels good right now|Also what way of breathing feels good right now]]_</span>

> [T]he breath needs to get subtle, the mind needs to get subtle. The journey of _samādhi_, the journey into _jhānas_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your mind to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus|Samadhi is more about open-heartedness, subtlety and refinement than focus]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> And really not a lot of air. It's really quite a gentle, subtle breath, relatively speaking. A long, slow, smooth breath, in and out. And alive to the whole body space, the whole energy body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Breathing with the Energy Body (Guided Meditation)#Allow the breath to be the longest possible comfortable breath|Allow the breath to be the longest possible comfortable breath]]_</span>

> [T]he whole body is breathing. The whole body space is involved.

> And what you're paying attention to is what feels good, what's helpful in terms of - remember the Buddha's analogy of the soap ball, and the apprentice bathman, bathperson, just shaping it. That's kind of what you're doing. You're using the breath to shape that ball into what feels good. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Breathing with the Energy Body (Guided Meditation)#You are using the breath to feel good|You are using the breath to feel good]]_</span>

> I think if you want to go deep in _mettā_, you probably want to eventually separate it from the breath, okay? Because you're going to get so deep that the breath actually stops. So you need to keep them separate. At the beginning, though, it might help... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Breathing with the Energy Body (Guided Meditation)#Metta might be an ingredient|Metta might be an ingredient]]_</span>
