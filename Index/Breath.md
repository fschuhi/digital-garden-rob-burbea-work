### Quotes
**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> You can actually be in the practice, doing the _mettā_ or the compassion - bring this in. Think about Big Bangs, and think about stardust and the way the breath is permeable. Bring it in, and see what happens. It needs practice, but it will lead to love and compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Interpenetrating|Interpenetrating]]_</span>

**[[Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Bring some energy. See them, bright, bright like the sun. White, golden light. Bright, shining, with the breath, with the whole body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath - Guided Meditation#3 The visual sense of the numbers|(3) The visual sense of the numbers]]_</span>

**[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> So in the whole space, attuned, alive, filled with awareness; the longest breath. Just how does it feel, the expansion and the contraction with the breath? Really tuning to that and feeling it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#The whole space is expanding on the in-breath contracting on the out-breath|The whole space is expanding on the in-breath, contracting on the out-breath]]_</span>

> Can you feel it right to the edges of the space, the whole body? Can you tune to, even enjoy, open to, this experience, the sense, the feeling of energization with the in-breath? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#The in-breath energizes the whole space|The in-breath energizes the whole space]]_</span>

> Energization through the whole space with the in-breath; a kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath. Qualities of energy that fill the whole space with the in-and the out-breaths. So this is what we want to tune to, open to, really feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#A kind of relaxation easing letting go with the out-breath|A kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath]]_</span>

> Can you imagine the feeling, a kinaesthetic imagination, the breath coming in at the solar plexus, and currents going simultaneously in opposite directions, up the body and down the body? Just play. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Maybe there is a double current of energy going up and down|Maybe there is a double current of energy, going up and down]]_</span>

> So is it keeping this really longest breath? Is it a very short breath? Is it somewhere in between? Is it a kind of very, very subtle breath, or a grosser breath? Smooth or coarse? What feels best right now? What way of breathing feels best right now? You have to experiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#What length of breath feels best right now|What length of breath feels best right now?]]_</span>

> So often, we just go into a default breath, and the only reason it feels comfortable is just because we're used to it. At that moment, it may well _not_ be that helpful in terms of really energizing, and opening, and healing, and soothing, and moving towards _samādhi_. So we have to be, again, willing to let go of our inertia, if it's there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Also what way of breathing feels good right now|Also what way of breathing feels good right now]]_</span>

> [T]he breath needs to get subtle, the mind needs to get subtle. The journey of _samādhi_, the journey into _jhānas_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your mind to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus|Samadhi is more about open-heartedness, subtlety and refinement than focus]]_</span>

> [W]e can shape the breath with our imagination, the breath energy, and that can have a real effect on our energy, of course. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#c Find a way of construing the breath that feels soothing|(c) Find a way of construing the breath that feels soothing]]_</span>
