### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> So this is quite interesting. Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of equanimity is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of juiciness, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of the self, the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe equanimity, true equanimity, actually has a quality of juiciness in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life|The near enemy is indifference and lack of juicyness in life]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other]]_</span>

> You need a fantasy of yourself as a practitioner - you know, a juicy, soulmaking, beautiful image fantasy of yourself, something that's operating in the background, a fantasy of the tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#You need a fantasy of the retreat|You need a fantasy of the retreat]]_</span>
