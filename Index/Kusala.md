### Quotes
**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hat he taught much more is this wholesome nourishment, wholesome developing of what's beautiful, and the well-being that that provides, and the _well_ of well-being that that provides_, and_ investigation. It's not that he taught a particular technique or you have to do this or that. It's those two together that were taught. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation but well-being and investigation|The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation, but well-being and investigation]]_</span>

> The actual route to the freedom, whether it fits in the neat confines of our image of some technique or not, that's totally irrelevant. The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters. And the principle is almost always the same for the Buddha: wholesome nourishment, investigation. And of course, in a life of practice, one has different approaches at different times. Of course one does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The route doesn't matter the freedom matters|The route doesn't matter, the freedom matters]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros is more than _mettā_ ; it's not the same as craving; it's not even just wholesome desire, _hitacchanda,_ or desire that leads to less suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology|We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology]]_</span>
