<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> We need, and particularly on a retreat like this, we need to take care, as much as possible, of a kind of baseline foundation of our sense of well-being, nourish our sense of happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#It works also in the reverse the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness|It works also in the reverse: the most important contributor to samadhi is happiness]]_</span>

> So if there's any kind of - even if it's unremarkable - sense of enjoying the practice, really let yourself enjoy it. See if you can bring that in and mix it in with what's going on. Open to the enjoyment, however it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#ad 3 attachment - - feeling good doesn't lead to attachment|ad 3. attachment - - feeling good doesn't lead to attachment]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And you drop a word in or a phrase, and it has some resonance in the body sensitivity, or the body feels peaceful, there's a feeling of peace around, there's a feeling of warmth, of happiness - actually connecting with that in the body, feeling it, feeling just a sense of comfort in the body, just a vague, unremarkable sense of well-being. That connection with those kinds of feelings in the body helps the _samādhi_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper|Body sensitivity allows samadhi to go deeper]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Even though we're opening ourselves to suffering, we're tuning into suffering, we're looking at it, we're willing to let the heart resonate with it - still, compassion is a pleasant quality.

> [W]hat he taught much more is this wholesome nourishment, wholesome developing of what's beautiful, and the well-being that that provides, and the _well_ of well-being that that provides_, and_ investigation. It's not that he taught a particular technique or you have to do this or that. It's those two together that were taught. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation but well-being and investigation|The Buddha didn't teach insight meditation, but well-being and investigation]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> '[B]liss' as an experience of the energy body, of great pleasantness in the energy body, of rapture or joy in the energy body, and that kind of openness, etc., sometimes very intense, sometimes much more subtle. {quote But that energy body experience of bliss, I would say, accompanies _any_ lightening or unfabricating, to whatever degree, of the self-sense, up to a certain point, at least. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#The "bliss" of soulmaking"|The "bliss" of soulmaking"]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> _Jhānas_ are a subset of _samādhi_, if you like. And _samādhi_ - it's actually quite hard to define, but it's something like a state of harmonious well-being of mind and body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Vocabulary jhanas are a subset of samadhi|Vocabulary: jhanas are a subset of samadhi]]_</span>

> [M]aybe most people, really need to forget the whole question that goes on: "Do I have it now? Is this it? Am I in a _jhāna_, or am I out of a _jhāna_ ?" And focus, rather, on enjoying, on just really maximizing your enjoyment... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#I might say "focus on maximizing your enjoyment"|I might say "focus on maximizing your enjoyment"]]_</span>

> [I]f there is an extraordinary opening to well-being or different kinds of well-being, if there's a really deep sense of different kinds of beauty, if there's a really profound sense of resource that's coming from that, if the practice of whatever it is you're doing brings, in an integrated way, insight and freedom, and it makes sense as part of the path in an integrated way, then _if_ we need to make definitions and demarcations, that would seem pretty good to call that a _jhāna_, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#A preliminary definition of what the jhana are|A preliminary definition of what the jhana are]]_</span>

> [T]hese things are insidious, these meta-level views, and they get into the nuts and bolts of how I'm regarding _this moment_ in the meditation. This moment, "Hmm, I'm thinking." Who _cares_ if you're thinking? Does it really matter? Is the thinking making you miserable, or is it the _view_ about the thinking that's making you miserable? Is that thinking even getting in the way of _samādhi,_ and well-being, and bliss, and ecstasy? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#"No thought"|"No thought"]]_</span>
