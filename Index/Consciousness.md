### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#But don't be in a hurry as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind|But don't be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind]]_</span>

> It's not that we're always going to stay in one state or another. It's something about being human, the amazing range of human consciousness. It's staggering, the capacity of the range of human consciousness to move along that whole spectrum. And somehow in that, and in accepting that movement, that's where our humanity is and our humility is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#A continuum of love|A continuum of love]]_</span>

> So it's just whatever's in consciousness, whatever's prominent, there the mettā goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight aversion here. And it's clear, and then the mettā comes in or the compassion or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob Both sensible and you'll get very quick at doing it either way|Rob: Both sensible, and you'll get very quick at doing it either way]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal. That universality, seeing that, understanding that, brings equanimity, as I said, but brings very deep compassion, because it's got very deep wisdom with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#The true nature of all things is immeasurable|The true nature of all things is immeasurable]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Just going through and just focusing on impermanence so that the fact of impermanence begins to impress itself deeply, deeply on the consciousness. And we begin more and more to be able to live that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#"Take up the theme" seeing impermanence in visual forms emotions body sensations sounds|"Take up the theme": seeing impermanence in visual forms, emotions, body sensations, sounds]]_</span>

> What if I saw everything as unsatisfactory? Just things come into consciousness, any experience, anything at all - just regard it as unsatisfactory. It's not a loathing or an aversion. Just saying, "Ah! It can't satisfy me." What happens is there's a letting go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Seeing things as unsatisfactory|Seeing things as unsatisfactory]]_</span>

> I was just being there, and the experience was getting more and more bright, more and more there, more and more present, more and more radiant. But if I keep letting go, it actually begins to fade. Experience itself begins to blur and dissolve and fade and become less prominent in consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#When you don't stop there experience begins to fade|When you don't stop there, experience begins to fade]]_</span>

> It's pointing to seeing this: the more I cling in any way, the more prominent experience is in consciousness. I begin to understand _how_ things arise and _how_ they fade. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Satipatthana Sutta|Satipatthana Sutta]]_</span>

> [A]bsolutely everything that we take for granted, is actually built and fabricated by my relationship to it, by the way I'm looking at it. Not to understand that, the Buddha called that the fundamental delusion, the fundamental ignorance that human beings have, or that consciousnesses have. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Everything is fabricated|Everything is fabricated]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So these practices, loving-kindness and compassion, are really dwellings for the heart: the heart, the being, the consciousness dwells in a space, in an inner space, of beauty, of sublimity, of something that feels divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places|Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And it seems at first that there was a person _here_ and a person _there_, and the love is moving towards them. It can deepen. And it's almost like the sense of the person begins to _blur_ a bit. And there is just the sense of two hearts, and a flow, a radiation, between the two hearts. And even that can deepen. And can become, at times, a sense of a kind of communion of hearts. There's just really one heart, one consciousness, imbued with love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#There can be a sense of flow between the two hearts a communion of hearts|There can be a sense of flow between the two hearts, a communion of hearts]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The very nature of consciousness itself is that it's always creating an object and shaping, colouring - 'fabricating' is the Buddha's word - fabricating an object. As such, there is no place to stand where you see a thing as it is _independently of the way I'm looking at it_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience|There is no moment of consciousness that is not shaping or creating or colouring or fabricating an experience]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So there's certainly a movement from formal practice that flows out into the life, but the other way round as well. The actions in our life will flow back into the heart and the consciousness when we come back to sit. Most things in Dharma work both ways in terms of causality. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Action i e putting ourselves in situations of service|Action, i.e. putting ourselves in situations of service]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards that experience itself, whatever the prominent experience right now, or whatever any experience in consciousness right now, just bathing it with kindness, with tenderness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Bathe that experience in kindness and compassion|Bathe that experience in kindness and compassion]]_</span>

> Including everything. You can even include the kindness itself. You can include the intention of kindness, the intention towards kindness. Gross or subtle, whatever is in consciousness in the moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation - Directing Love Towards Dharmas#Including everything bathing it holding it touching it|Including everything, bathing it, holding it, touching it]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The problem is something _we_ bring into it through our relationship with it. In itself, any experience is empty of problem. It's so important, that level of insight. So absolutely crucial. And you can - even as I say it, you get a sense of the immense kind of both potential and responsibility that gives to consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it|The suffering goes out of experience to the degree that we can soften our struggle with it]]_</span>

> Vast sense of oneness - beautiful. Beautiful for consciousness to open up to, at times. But even that is actually empty. It's still a perception that's come into being through the way we are looking, through our relationship _with_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking|Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking]]_</span>

> And then if you really want to turn your consciousness inside out, grasping builds experience. What builds grasping? Experience. I can't grasp without anything to grasp at. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#I can't grasp without anything to grasp at|I can't grasp without anything to grasp at]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros involves and leads to soulmaking, and widening of the senses of sacredness beyond just the 'is-ness' of things, and even beyond the transcendence that's possible for us, for consciousness, transcendence in oneness or the Unfabricated. And opening up sacredness wider than a kind of universal sacredness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 2#Recap Why eros why this delineation|Recap: Why eros, why this delineation?]]_</span>

**[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> **Bring the attention back to myself, and actually notice and feel the _dukkha_ of that ill-will _here_ .** _It's in_ my _heart. There's a taste in my mouth. It's a flavour in my energy body and my consciousness. It's_ dukkha. It's painful. So I'm not trying to change the ill-will. I just come back, and I feel what's happening. Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _dukkha_." And feel the pain of it. I just have to let my consciousness touch the pain there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#a Ill-will i Metta to the one I'm upset with ii to myself|(a) Ill-will, (i) Metta to the one I'm upset with (ii) to myself]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> The mindfulness expands to include that: "Oh, okay. There's self-consciousness going on as well. There's a bit of [[anxiety]], or even a lot of anxiety about looking silly or whatever it is, or sounding silly." Can there be a bit more space in the consciousness? Because anxiety will contract the space of the [[awareness]]. Sometimes just creating a bit more space can help. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#There might be self-consciousness arising|There might be self-consciousness arising]]_</span>
