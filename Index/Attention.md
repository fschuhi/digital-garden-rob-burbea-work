### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So, you know, the analogy of, there's the mountain, and there's the peak of the mountain, and that's where we're headed, but the step is right here, right now. And we can see where we're going, and pay attention to where we are right now. And it's both. It's finding a sensitive balance of that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Chanda noble aspiration|Chanda = noble aspiration]]_</span>

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs|Rob: attention is kind of like prongs]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference|Impermanence is an obvious fact, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So all this, there's a lot of experimentation with all of it. But the attention to how it feels is really important. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Experiment how joy can feel like|Experiment how joy can feel like]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So part of the developing the art is deepening this sensitivity and subtlety of attention to effort levels. And we learn: "Oh, a bit more, you know, a bit more foot on the gas; a bit off, a bit more off." Part of the art - play with it. Experiment. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#The body reflects if there is too much effort|The body reflects if there is too much effort]]_</span>

**[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego|Compassion to self does not build the ego]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated. And I start to see, again: dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my experience, my perception, and what appears to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear|Even the pleasant vedana become neutral, and even those neutral sensations disappear]]_</span>

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty|Not just that is not me, but it is empty]]_</span>

> The mind kind of grasps - like a pair of calipers, it grasps at the object that we're paying attention to. Even attention is a form of clinging. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even attention is a form of clinging|Even attention is a form of clinging]]_</span>

> [W]e see how clinging, craving, _saṅkhārā_, _avijjā_, attention - these notions overlap. They're all different forms of clinging... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even attention is a form of clinging|Even attention is a form of clinging]]_</span>

> I can't live without clinging, because clinging is a part of perceiving/experiencing anything. As I said, it's part of attention. And when I really let go of clinging very deeply, in that moment, appearances do not appear. There is no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving|I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving]]_</span>

**[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> So four things your attention has to hold together, coordinate, and really open yourself to, give your attention to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#4 The inner hearing|(4) The inner hearing]]_</span>

> Keep stretching that attention - the whole body, whole body space, filled with alive, alert presence and sensitivity. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#Don't worry if you don't have a visual imagination|Don't worry if you don't have a visual imagination]]_</span>

**[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Certainly in our wider culture, it's like, "What do you _mean_ when you say 'vibration,' 'texture,' 'feeling,' 'energy'?" We're not trained with the kind of quality or poise of attention that reveals that kind of realm or stratum of experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#"Energy body" is the vibration texture feeling energy of the whole body space|"Energy body" is the vibration, texture, feeling, energy of the whole body space]]_</span>

> If you can get a sense, it's like the space feels relaxed. It's not heavy, intense attention. Intense attention has its place, and we'll talk about that - the energization of attention. But what I'm really talking about as we move around is a kind of open, easeful attention, and an open, easeful body, and they go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#During the day aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open|During the day, aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open]]_</span>

> That kind of relationship, that kind of state of energy body awareness. What kind of stance or pressure do I have to have? Do I need to kind of loosen off and relax a little bit, or actually do I need to bring and cohere my attention a bit more? So always there's a question, and the question invites us into this playfulness, responsiveness, sensitivity - the whole deal. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Again the seed question what helps|Again, the seed question: what helps?]]_</span>

**[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> If you come into an interview and you report to me that you just didn't have any hindrances, I'd just say you're not paying attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Watch out for the habit of letting-be in standard mindfulness practice|Watch out for the habit of letting-be in standard mindfulness practice]]_</span>

> **Bring the attention back to myself, and actually notice and feel the _dukkha_ of that ill-will _here_ .** _It's in_ my _heart. There's a taste in my mouth. It's a flavour in my energy body and my consciousness. It's_ dukkha. It's painful. So I'm not trying to change the ill-will. I just come back, and I feel what's happening. Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _dukkha_." And feel the pain of it. I just have to let my consciousness touch the pain there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#a Ill-will i Metta to the one I'm upset with ii to myself|(a) Ill-will, (i) Metta to the one I'm upset with (ii) to myself]]_</span>

> And what you're paying attention to is what feels good, what's helpful in terms of - remember the Buddha's analogy of the soap ball, and the apprentice bathman, bathperson, just shaping it. That's kind of what you're doing. You're using the breath to shape that ball into what feels good. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Breathing with the Energy Body (Guided Meditation)#You are using the breath to feel good|You are using the breath to feel good]]_</span>
