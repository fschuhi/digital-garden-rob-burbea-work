> [T]he mystical opening, the kiss of the mystic. For me, that's a really important point and reason. I want my sense of existence, my sense of world, of self, of other, to open up. And it will be in the impress and the opening of these beautiful realms and experiences. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas as mystical openings|Jhanas as mystical openings]]_</span>
