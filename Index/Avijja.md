### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> No perception, no mind. They go together. To have a mind, you need to have a perception. If there's no world, there's no perception and no mind. The mind is inextricably linked up with what it perceives, which is the universe. Mind is not separate from the world. It feels separate. Self feels separate from others, from the world, from the universe. Mind feels separate. This is the great delusion. Not separate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions|Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> [A]bsolutely everything that we take for granted, is actually built and fabricated by my relationship to it, by the way I'm looking at it. Not to understand that, the Buddha called that the fundamental delusion, the fundamental ignorance that human beings have, or that consciousnesses have. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Everything is fabricated|Everything is fabricated]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And there's a way that the self and the very individuality and uniqueness of the self is inextricably bound up with, actually, _everything else_ in the whole universe. We have a delusion of separateness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe|This individuality is bound up with everything else in the universe]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> We need to see this dependent fabrication and dependent fading many, many times, because it's such a deep level of delusion that's entrenched there for us to believe in the reality of things... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#We need to see the fading many times|We need to see the fading many times]]_</span>

> So if we don't understand this teaching deeply enough, some level of realism (which is basically delusion, _avijjā_) remains... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#"Just being and receiving" is still a way of looking|"Just being and receiving" is still a way of looking]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> _[A]vijjā_ is clinging, this belief in the reality of something existing independently from the way of looking. It's a clinging. I need to refine my practice until I can actually play with the spectrum, actually move that clinging of delusion up and down on a spectrum, and see what happens. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#2 spectrum of fabrication emptiness|2. spectrum of fabrication (emptiness)]]_</span>

> [T]hey can't postpone the soul-calling to include an exploration of eros fully, richly, deeply on the path. Can't postpone it. Not yet got all that more straight-ahead stuff figured out, but I can't postpone it either. Is that just the pull of delusion, the impatience of delusion? Not necessarily. There are some who actually don't do things in the order that a neat way of framing things might prefer. So be it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Some hear the calling to explore eros more fully|Some hear the calling to explore eros more fully]]_</span>
