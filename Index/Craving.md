### Quotes
**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no thing, there is no real thing that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#The appearance of something depends on the grasping|The appearance of something depends on the grasping]]_</span>

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs|Rob: attention is kind of like prongs]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> There's absolutely love in it. In that state, there's a kind of non-separation. We're not building a sense of self and other, a sense of separation, by getting involved in this tussle, in this push and pull. In the non-separation, there's love, effortlessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#There is wonder beauty love and juiciness in equanimity practice|There is wonder, beauty, love and juiciness in equanimity practice]]_</span>

> How a thing appears depends on my relationship to it. Whether it appears at all depends on my relationship to it. How a thing is, then, depends on the push and the pull, and is inherently immeasurable. There is no real way it is. It's immeasurable. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them|More important than the experience is the understanding how things appearing depends on my relationship to them]]_</span>

> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal. That universality, seeing that, understanding that, brings equanimity, as I said, but brings very deep compassion, because it's got very deep wisdom with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#The true nature of all things is immeasurable|The true nature of all things is immeasurable]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Difficult things are held in place, basically, by aversion, by grasping, by identification, by all these things we're talking about letting go of. So as you let go of them, they tend to fade. Happiness, at one level, or peace, or joy, is also held in place by grasping, to an extent. But it's a more subtle kind of grasping. What one finds is that if one lets go of the grasping towards happiness, the happiness actually deepens. It becomes more refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#When we let go we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience and it begins to fade|When we let go, we're actually taking away some of what is building an experience, and it begins to fade]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> _[C]handa_ is more 'aspiration,' 'will to do.' It's actually the fuel for our practice. And where do teachings land? Does _taṇhā_ grab hold of them and make a problem out of it? Or does _chanda_? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Tanha vs chanda|Tanha vs chanda]]_</span>

> We can actually learn to relax the grasping and see the suffering go out. It doesn't feed suffering. Equanimity and love, in their depths, are non-grasping - there isn't a pushing away or a pulling towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#In its depth the nature of love is non-grasping|In its depth, the nature of love is non-grasping]]_</span>

> [T]he more welcoming there is, basically the less aversion, the less pushing away and pulling towards (we say "less pushing and pulling"; that's less grasping), and what we notice is that the world, the world of experience, appears less. And if there's really very little grasping, it can be that very little appears at all. It just kind of dissolves, dissolves, dissolves. So it's really to see that. And to conclude from that, there's something about grasping that's actually building experience. I don't know that one can explain it any more than that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#The less grasping the less appears at all|The less grasping, the less appears at all]]_</span>

> And then if you really want to turn your consciousness inside out, grasping builds experience. What builds grasping? Experience. I can't grasp without anything to grasp at. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#I can't grasp without anything to grasp at|I can't grasp without anything to grasp at]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And that calmness, like when the water is calm in a pond or a lake or something, I can actually pick up even more subtle levels of craving. So then I can feel that, very subtle, and release those, and even more calm. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#The calmer I get the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up|The calmer I get, the even more subtle levels of craving I can pick up]]_</span>

> More craving, more self, if you like. Less craving, less self gets fabricated. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Less craving less self gets fabricated - - fading|Less craving, less self gets fabricated - - fading]]_</span>

> More craving, more solid and more dense and more real, if you like, the world becomes, and more oppressive. Let go of craving, let go at a deeper level, start to see these dependencies, start to see objects, too, begin to fade out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Less craving less self gets fabricated - - fading|Less craving, less self gets fabricated - - fading]]_</span>

> It's not really opening things out in a very deep way, to hang on, to cling, in effect, to a distinction between craving and clinging, for instance. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice|Uncovering more subtle levels of dukkha is a lovely practice]]_</span>

> [W]e see how clinging, craving, _saṅkhārā_, _avijjā_, attention - these notions overlap. They're all different forms of clinging... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even attention is a form of clinging|Even attention is a form of clinging]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [I]s it even possible to create a large form (say a long piece of music, or a novel, or a film or something, or a painting that takes a long time) without craving, clinging, attachment, desire? Or training - the long, dedicated training it takes to develop that kind of mastery in spontaneity... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Art sexuality without desire|Art, sexuality without desire?]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [T]hese teachings are integrated into the usual Dharma teachings about craving and letting go and releasing _dukkha_, and the much deeper teachings about dependent arising and emptiness, and that forms a non-realist basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations|The different ways of looking form a non-realist basis for explanations and explorations]]_</span>

> [E]ros is more than _mettā_ ; it's not the same as craving; it's not even just wholesome desire, _hitacchanda,_ or desire that leads to less suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology|We need a more sophisticated Dharma psychology]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [C]raving is a kind of desire that does _not_ lead to soulmaking. Actually, it leads to a kind of contraction. Soulmaking is an opening movement, and craving brings contraction. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#11 Craving|(11) Craving]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [C]raving, grasping, aversion, it tends to solidify the perception of that object that we're clinging to. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception and vice versa|Clinging leads to a solidification and stagnation of perception, and vice versa]]_</span>

> But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object. Its effect is to liberate the perception, in a certain sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception it liberates it|Soulmaking is thus the opposite of stagnating or solidifying the perception, it liberates it]]_</span>
