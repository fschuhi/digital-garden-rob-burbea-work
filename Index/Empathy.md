### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So we see sorrow in someone, and somehow we also feel sorrow. This is, to me, a miraculous quality of the human heart - maybe some animals' as well; I don't know. The heart has a capacity to resonate, in a very beautiful way, with the sorrow that it encounters in the world. So that's a huge part of compassion. Maybe half of compassion is empathy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Compassion involves different qualities e g empathy|Compassion involves different qualities, e.g. empathy]]_</span>

> Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|Balance this with a healing energy (2) giving out]]_</span>

> Some people just use the phrases much more lightly, and this allows the sense of drawing close to the suffering, of empathy, and also of giving. So play with that. Play with how heavily and tightly you hold the phrases. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion is a lighter energy than metta so phrases can be used more lightly|Compassion is a lighter energy than metta, so phrases can be used more lightly]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving|Recap: balancing of receiving and giving]]_</span>
