> It doesn't open that up. It doesn't nourish it. It doesn't bring water to it. It doesn't fan the fire. It doesn't bring out the beauty, reveal the beauty, the dimensions there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Certain viewpoints cannot fan the fire|Certain viewpoints cannot fan the fire]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [W]henever there is a sense of soulfulness, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, dimensionality, beauty, meaningfulness, in our existence, in the being, whenever there is soulmaking, sacredness in our existence, eros is involved. Eros is involved whenever there is soulmaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros involves energy embodiment the imaginal and logos|Eros involves energy, embodiment, the imaginal, and logos]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]veryone uses the word self: I, you, self, etc. And everyone experiences selves. Everyone experiences selves - their own self or selves, and the selves of others. It's just the same, or rather it's similar with the notion of divinity. We're talking about experience, okay? Just as 'self' is a word that we use, an experience, so is 'divinity' - or rather, 'divinity' is a whole range of experiences, a whole range of dimensions of experiences, if you like, that will become evident, that will appear in one's experience, _if_ we do not block, dismiss, or rule it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#"Divinity" is a whole range of experiences|"Divinity" is a whole range of experiences]]_</span>

> And so there's a kind of self-feeding, self-generating, ongoing fertilization, mutual fertilization of eros, psyche, logos; mutual widening, deepening, enriching, complicating, adding dimensionality, etc., that goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Mutual fertilization of erso psyche logos|Mutual fertilization of erso, psyche, logos]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros, wanting more, it deepens and creates/discovers more to the image, gives more imaginal dimensions, imaginal complexity, imaginal facets and faces to this beloved other, and in that, the idea, the logos, also, of this other expands. That eros-psyche-logos, that soulmaking dynamic, then comes back, because the object then is more beautiful, more deep, more rich, more juicy, more enticing, more complex. It offers me more. It offers more for the psyche, so to speak, to move into, to expand, but also for the eros to find attractive and to want more of. So there's this way that it kind of, potentially infinitely, in a way, just expands. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#Eros psyche logos they all help each other|Eros, psyche, logos, they all help each other]]_</span>

**[[Daimon, Refracted]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Four Circles, Four Parables of Stone and Light]]</span>
> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that|Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that]]_</span>

> The self needs to become image. It wants to become image. Soul wants to make things imaginal, to discover their imaginal dimensions. And it needs to imprint. It wants to express itself. It wants to connect with other souls. This is how soul grows. Soulmaking _is_ being impressed upon. The sense of soulfulness _is_ to be impressed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The imaginal sense is me and not me neither real nor not real|The imaginal sense is me and not me, neither real nor not real]]_</span>

> So sometimes connecting with an image and recognizing, feeling, opening to its love for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the dimensionality and the divinity and the beauty, etc., that, in a way, that kind of love, the love that images have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned love, it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The love images have for us can heal the inner critic|The love images have for us can heal the inner critic]]_</span>

> [T]he _Sefirot_, they remain impersonal, but the self begins to be given a kind of dimensionality and divinity, and it's complexified, etc., in that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Parallel between dharmakaya and Sefirot|Parallel between dharmakaya and Sefirot]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [T]he _jhānas_ - they're almost like dimensions of being, if you like. They're beautiful, amazing dimensions of being, treasures, treasure realms, enchanted realms. And they're there, and they're available for us. And this becomes a part of one's life, and a part of one's sense of what existence _is_ and what the cosmos includes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being already there|Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being, already there]]_</span>

>  And I find more and more these days, when things are difficult, when there's challenge different ways, that the sense (and I mean that word in its double meaning: the sense, the actual [[perception]], and the idea) of my human being or another human being is more along the lines of this [[Image|image and analogue]], of having [[Dimensionality|angelic dimensions]] which are refracted into the human life more or less at different times, with a [[duty]] to that.... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 3#The sense and sensing of being larger having angelic dimensions|The sense and sensing of being larger, having angelic dimensions]]_</span>

> The meaning of this and the dimensionality, or the meaning of this and the sensing with soul of what's opened up through the meaning of what's being said in my voice, but also the dimensions that are opened up just through the sound, through the [[music]] of it, the mystery of it, the miracle of hearing and of sound. This particular sound, right now. This particular music. Different than other musics. Unique, particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#The mircacle of hearing and of sound|The mircacle of hearing and of sound]]_</span>
