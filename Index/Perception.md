### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> No perception, no mind. They go together. To have a mind, you need to have a perception. If there's no world, there's no perception and no mind. The mind is inextricably linked up with what it perceives, which is the universe. Mind is not separate from the world. It feels separate. Self feels separate from others, from the world, from the universe. Mind feels separate. This is the great delusion. Not separate. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions|Non-separation as corrolary to the mind having perceptions]]_</span>

**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation|Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation]]_</span>

> But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no thing, there is no real thing that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#The appearance of something depends on the grasping|The appearance of something depends on the grasping]]_</span>

> There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob attention is kind of like prongs|Rob: attention is kind of like prongs]]_</span>

> My take on it, as well, is that a person can be awakened to some degree, and there's basically a momentum of saṅkhāras, of karmic momentum, to basically perceive things and things existing really. And that momentum for the duration of their life is enough to keep the world appearing for them. And then, theoretically, when they die, it all kind of dissolves into whatever it does. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things|Rob: Maybe only Buddhas can see emptiness and not bump into things]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]_</span>

> That principle is something that applies to all consciousnesses - not even just human beings; all consciousnesses. Whenever there's a consciousness, the appearance of things to that consciousness depends on the push and the pull, the relationship with. And that's universal. That universality, seeing that, understanding that, brings equanimity, as I said, but brings very deep compassion, because it's got very deep wisdom with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#The true nature of all things is immeasurable|The true nature of all things is immeasurable]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> To have a perception, I need the rest of the universe to perceive. So we can talk about emptiness. We can also say emptiness is fullness: _this_ is _full_ of everything. This being, these beings, this self is _full_ of the universe. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Perception is a double-sided feature|Perception is a double-sided feature]]_</span>

> [A]nger _colours_ the perception at times. And we even have a phrase in English: one is 'seeing red.' I was seeing red, or he's seeing red; she's seeing red. The very words are implying this colouring of perception. One's looking at the world, at the situation in that moment, through the lenses of anger. And the perception is correspondingly changed - of a person, of ourselves, of a situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Example angers colours the perception and so does metta|Example: angers colours the perception, and so does metta]]_</span>

> The mind, the heart begins to soften because one's meeting oneself with _mettā - can_ do. Things soften, the mind softens, the _eyes_ then soften, and the _perception_ softens, because perception is dependent on the state of the mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself perception softens|With metta towards the difficult person or towards oneself, perception softens]]_</span>

> Vast sense of oneness - beautiful. Beautiful for consciousness to open up to, at times. But even that is actually empty. It's still a perception that's come into being through the way we are looking, through our relationship _with_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking|Even oneness is a perception which comes into being through the way we are looking]]_</span>

> You know, you're afraid walking at night in the dark, and you see the shadows, and it looks like, you know, a big ... [laughter] And it's not. It's just the shadows coloured with the perception from the fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#With fear the object and the fear are not independent|With fear, the object and the fear are not independent]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Axiomatic: there's nothing beyond this. What do you mean by _this_? What do you mean? Poke, question. What do you mean by _this_? Do you mean matter? Or do you mean appearances? Big difference in what is meant. If you mean matter, what is it that you mean by matter? {quote If you mean appearances, there's nothing beyond appearances, again, what exactly do you mean? And do you understand, through meditation, the dependent arising and the dependent fading and cessation of all appearances, so that there can be a beyond this, a beyond appearances? This is available in meditation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"|"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"?]]_</span>

> Big ideas can open up the whole sense of existence - the questioning, the perception, everything. That opening up won't happen just by 'being with,' or just by being with my feelings, if I'm 'being with' with the same unquestioned ways of looking, unquestioned conceptual framework, etc., unquestioned metaphysics, really. We somehow need to question and to put in new ideas. Somehow. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible|Is a wholly different relationship with fundamental ideas possible?]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> What does it mean to say that appearances appear, but they are empty? They're dependent arisings. They're fabrications. They're illusory. They do not exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Dependent arisings are empty fabricated illusiory|Dependent arisings are empty, fabricated, illusiory]]_</span>

> There's no sensation there in the knee any more. I'm staring right at it. It's not that I'm not paying attention. I'm certainly not distracted. It's faded. It's unfabricated. And I start to see, again: dependent on the way of looking is the construction of my experience, my perception, and what appears to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Even the pleasant vedana become neutral and even those neutral sensations disappear|Even the pleasant vedana become neutral, and even those neutral sensations disappear]]_</span>

> Not just that it is not me and it is not mine, but it is, in itself, empty. It's an illusory appearance, to borrow the Buddha's terminology. It's a fabrication. It's a concoction. It's a construction - a construction dependent on the way of looking. If I look in a certain way, the world appears, and it appears very solid. If I look in other ways, it appears, but it appears much less solid. And if I look in certain ways, certain ways of looking, if I pay attention in certain ways of looking, it does not appear. This thing that was troubling me, this thing that I loved, this thing that was neutral, fades. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Not just that is not me but it is empty|Not just that is not me, but it is empty]]_</span>

> I can't live without clinging, because clinging is a part of perceiving/experiencing anything. As I said, it's part of attention. And when I really let go of clinging very deeply, in that moment, appearances do not appear. There is no perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving|I cannot live without clinging because it is a part of perceiving]]_</span>

> I cannot have a full leaning on the insight of emptiness at the same time as I have the appearance of an object. It will fade to the degree that I lean on, that I allow the fullness of that knowing of its emptiness into the way of looking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#Only Buddhas can contemplate emptiness and appearance at the same time|Only Buddhas can contemplate emptiness and appearance at the same time]]_</span>

> [D]on't cling to non-clinging. It's empty, and it's wrapped up in perception. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 2#No clinger no clung to no clinging|No clinger, no clung to, no clinging]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> And always in Dharma inquiry, always, there's something really fundamental to see: there's a principle that how we view something - always we see that how we view something affects the perception of that 'something.' The ideas that I have, the preconceptions, the conceptions, the relationship with the 'something' that I'm investigating, the area of inquiry, affects my perception of that 'something,' and affects the related experiences that unfold, that can unfold, or that will unfold. All that's to do with dependent arising. The view, the way of looking, affects. It shapes the perception, fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#3 Opening a direction of investigation|3.

> The assumption that this or that is underneath appearances, or it's really matter, or all appearances/perceptions come from the brain, these are all assumptions.

> But when I talk about logos, because it's wrapped up in perception, I'm not talking about something abstract. We _live_ a logos, or we live logoi. We live different ideas.

> Buddha-nature, _dharmakāya_, emptiness, the Absolute, and other words (there are quite a few words that are used interchangeably), means something like the cosmic awareness that is inherently in me and in you and in everything, that knows the emptiness of all things, is not separate (as separating subjects and objects). In that sense, it's non-dual. It refers, then, to the knowing - which is also empty; this knowing awareness is empty in itself - but the knowing and_ the appearances _and_ their emptiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 3#Buddha-nature according to Shentong|Buddha-nature according to Shentong]]_</span>

> [E]ros leads, brings, stimulates, opens a perception of - more and more so, in fact, as it goes on - a perception of the beauty and the divinity. More and more, as I said, this grows, the divinity of the object, of the erotic object. Eros opens the perception of beauty and divinity, and we can't help but love what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#But it's not possible to have eros without love|But it's not possible to have eros without love]]_</span>

> But what that means is that eros, in its capacity to open perception and see also image as image, is very different than grasping, aversion, clinging, craving. It has the opposite effect. It doesn't solidify. It doesn't stagnate. Actually, it _liberates_ the object.
