### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [Compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) is something that's actually energizing and healing, and moves towards the alleviation of suffering. Self-pity will just keep it cycling. It's disempowering. It actually _keeps_ suffering there. Compassion to self and other is empowering and not debilitating. So in the practice, you can see: when has pity crept in, and is there some way I can equalize things again? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Self-pity is disempowering|Self-pity is disempowering]]_</span>

> In that climate of compassion, with a little bit more broad awareness, it's like a lens of looking at the present moment, the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering, in the moment. So we begin to see little sufferings, little ways that we're creating suffering. And organically somehow, because of the compassion practice, we can just unhook. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Looking at the present experience through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering|Looking at the present experience, through the lens of seeing suffering and the end of suffering]]_</span>

> Oftentimes with our own suffering, we're actually adding to the suffering by sort of adding an extra layer of isolation, and we don't even realize that we're doing it. We're just contracted around my suffering and we don't realize the commonality. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#When we see the humanity of the suffering compassion for ourselves can begin to come in|When we see the humanity of the suffering, compassion for ourselves can begin to come in]]_</span>

> We need, as I said, to touch the suffering of life with the compassion practice, and also to see the commonality and see the oneness. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#We need to touch suffering with compassion and also see the commonality and the oneness|We need to touch suffering with compassion, and also see the commonality and the oneness]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> But sometimes it can be just the sense of contraction is a sense of suffering. And one notices that when there's pushing or pulling or aversion, there's suffering there. As I relax that, the suffering goes. And being actually sensitive to the suffering and the release of suffering is really key in the deepening of equanimity. So there's a real sensitivity to suffering and its release, and suffering and its release, and suffering and its release, as the process deepens... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Rob feeling the suffering is important because there's a lot insight in this approach|Rob: feeling the suffering is important because there's a lot insight in this approach]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So any seeing or understanding that brings just an ease, some easing or completely dissolving of dukkha - that's what we call "insight." Now, that can happen intellectually, but if it's just intellectual understanding, and it doesn't lead to this easing, this lessening of suffering, it doesn't actually count or qualify as an insight. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#General definition of insight that which brings lessening of suffering|General definition of insight: that which brings lessening of suffering]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The question, Dharmically, is not that that shouldn't be there, that we shouldn't have a sense of our individuality and our uniqueness. It's rather, is the way that I'm regarding my personality, my uniqueness, my individuality, is the way I'm holding that leading to suffering for me and suffering to others? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Am I wrapped up in an unhelpful self-view|Am I wrapped up in an unhelpful self-view?]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So we typically look in ways that actually lead to clinging, lead to suffering. That's what we do all the time. The Buddha said, "Can you learn to look in different ways that bring release?" Release of the clinging brings release from suffering, and that brings love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Alternative practice ways of looking that bring release|Alternative: practice ways of looking that bring release]]_</span>

> Why did the Buddha go on and on and on and on about clinging? Clinging brings suffering. Clinging closes the heart. Releasing clinging brings freedom; it also brings love. And we can notice this so we're crystal clear about it, and there's just no arguing about it. It's very, very clear to us. We feel it in the heart and in the body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#f feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre|f) feel energetically the opening and closing of the heart centre]]_</span>

> So it's a different question than, "If a tree falls in the forest, and there's no one around, does it make a noise?" It's not going there, to that question. It's avoiding that question. We're talking about experience and understanding experience in the light of suffering arising or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that|Nothing exists outside of what one's bringing to that]]_</span>

> At a very deep level, when we begin to undermine that belief in the independent existence of things, then our whole sense of reality is opened up. It's almost as if suffering can't land anywhere; we can't land anywhere to struggle with anything. Or we believe that less and less, put it that way. And then comes more and more a sense of freedom, and love comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled|The whole nature of perception begins to be unravelled]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [C]ompassion is the heart's natural response to suffering when not preoccupied with self, or not caught up in a negative self-view. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering|Compassion is the heart's natural response to suffering]]_</span>

> [W]hen the stream of loving-kindness, the stream of _mettā -_ if it's running, when it meets suffering, it turns organically and very naturally into compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#It wants to alleviate the suffering|It wants to alleviate the suffering]]_</span>

> But compassion as such is not blind. Compassion has in it some degree of understanding of what the causes of suffering are, and in it, a willingness and a wish to uncover the causes of suffering, at as deep a level as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity and wisdom|Compassion also includes the steadiness of equanimity, and wisdom]]_</span>

> Even though we're opening ourselves to suffering, we're tuning into suffering, we're looking at it, we're willing to let the heart resonate with it - still, compassion is a pleasant quality. It's a pleasant abiding, a sublime or divine abiding. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Energizing rather tiring pleasant rather than unpleasant|Energizing rather tiring, pleasant rather than unpleasant]]_</span>

> [S]earching for happiness through self-centredness actually leads to suffering. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#We can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness|We can't really be fully fulfilled pursuing happiness through self-centredness]]_</span>

> And the presence of the fear actually tends to either make us feel overwhelmed, which is what we were fearing anyway, and/or increases our sense of suffering when we are open to the suffering of others. So the fear is exactly doing what we're afraid we would feel anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#1 Fear|(1) Fear]]_</span>

> It embraces suffering, holds it, accommodates it, and then adds healing, and adds understanding. So it's not an aversive movement; it's a holding, and a bringing in of healing and understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding|Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding]]_</span>

> Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|Balance this with a healing energy (2) giving out]]_</span>

> It's as if the sense of the heart expands and _can_ expand so that it feels almost like it fills the space, or as if the suffering in the world is being held by a compassion that, in a way, is part of the fabric of the universe. It's a kind of universal compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#3 Spaciousness|(3) Spaciousness]]_</span>

> [T]he suffering in the world is _held -_ held, we could say, in the love of the universe, in the compassion of the universe, in the heart of God, whatever language works. It's almost like something deepens, and the true nature of the heart is seen as not limited, but actually infinite and vast. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#We can get sometimes a sense of a compassion that it's not the self doing it|We can get sometimes a sense of a compassion that it's not the self doing it]]_</span>

> "It's just me that has this. I'm the one that goes through this. No one else has this." Sometimes it's not even a conscious thought, and we're adding, we're stacking on the suffering by this isolating of ourselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Reflect on that my suffering is actually not different from the suffering of others|Reflect on that my suffering is actually not different from the suffering of others]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [S]ometimes where we think the suffering is isn't always where it is, in the most obvious sense. And anyway, suffering is not measurable. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Story leprosy community in Indea|Story: leprosy community in Indea]]_</span>

> So because we're most intimate with this psychophysical organism, that's where we learn the most. And that wisdom then translates and transfers into compassion for others, because we understand the roots of suffering. The more we understand the roots of suffering, the more compassion there can be for all beings. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with|This suffering here is the one we can be most intimate with]]_</span>

> A wrong kind of self-attention feeds, builds the ego and builds the self-sense, whereas an attention that's full of compassion, full of tenderness, full of acceptance and care, full of insight into questioning, "How is it that this suffering has come about?" - that kind of direction of the attention towards self does not build the ego, will not build the ego, will actually soften things, will actually allow things to become looser and more spacious. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion Part Two - Compassion for Ourselves#Compassion to self does not build the ego|Compassion to self does not build the ego]]_</span>
