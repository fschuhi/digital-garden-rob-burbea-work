### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [Compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) is something that's actually energizing and healing, and moves towards the alleviation of suffering. Self-pity will just keep it cycling. It's disempowering. It actually _keeps_ suffering there. Compassion to self and other is empowering and not debilitating. So in the practice, you can see: when has pity crept in, and is there some way I can equalize things again? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Self-pity is disempowering|Self-pity is disempowering]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or grief, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a beauty to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that energy that's going out - the lovely quality of healing, of light, the balm, the comforting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy|(2) Wanting to heal the suffering (energy)]]_</span>

> What's going out, the comforting, the balm, it actually has a feeling of feeling pleasant, and of feeling quite healing. So in coming out of our being, it's actually touching us on its way out to others. And we feel healed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us and we feel healed|The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us, and we feel healed]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> It embraces suffering, holds it, accommodates it, and then adds healing, and adds understanding. So it's not an aversive movement; it's a holding, and a bringing in of healing and understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding|Compassion holds suffering and then adds healing and understanding]]_</span>

> Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|Balance this with a healing energy (2) giving out]]_</span>

**[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Holding it all in compassion. Allowing it to be held in compassion. Realizing, reflecting: nothing, absolutely nothing is outside this web, this infinite web. Sustaining us, nourishing us, giving to us. And that we too are part of that web. Sensitive to suffering. Letting it be held in compassion. And just allowing a sense of space to open up. And allowing the body to just radiate out compassion in space, filling space, all space, all directions. Filling it with that tenderness, with that healing. Holding all things in compassion. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Guided Meditation on Gratitude and Compassion#Compassion to all animals and plant life|Compassion to all animals and plant life]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving|Recap: balancing of receiving and giving]]_</span>

**[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> So often, we just go into a default breath, and the only reason it feels comfortable is just because we're used to it. At that moment, it may well _not_ be that helpful in terms of really energizing, and opening, and healing, and soothing, and moving towards _samādhi_. So we have to be, again, willing to let go of our inertia, if it's there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Also what way of breathing feels good right now|Also what way of breathing feels good right now]]_</span>
