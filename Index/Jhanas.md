> We have to get the view right (the view is the platform), and the whole relationship right. So if I say something like that - "Oh, the Buddha said, '_Jhānas_ depend on happiness'" - that should set you thinking. Well, I see some of you writing it down. It's important. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#The view is the platform|The view is the platform]]_</span>

> "We're not into brittle _jhānas._ We're not into brittle _samādhi_." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#"Open schedule" means that it's on you to find a working temporal structure|"Open schedule" means that it's on you to find a working temporal structure]]_</span>

> Like so many things, _jhānas_ lead to malleability. Guess what? Malleability leads to _jhānas._ In other words, it's a condition for _jhānas_. So malleability now is the opposite of inertia. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind|One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind]]_</span>

> You won't access _jhānas_ unless you're willing to be malleable, and you play and you play, and get into trying different things. You've got to be, in a way, practising on your toes, ready, responsive. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind|One of the fruits of jhanas is malleability of mind]]_</span>

> When I say '_jhāna_ practice,' I mean also working with the difficulties, the yucky stuff, the sludge, and slogging away through it, etc. I mean also, when I say '_jhāna_ practice,' the whole relationship with practice, the whole view of the self doing the practice, and trying to do the practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#We want firm clear simple intention for "jhana practice"|We want firm, clear, simple intention for "jhana practice"]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> _Jhānas_ are a subset of _samādhi_, if you like. And _samādhi_ - it's actually quite hard to define, but it's something like a state of harmonious well-being of mind and body. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Vocabulary jhanas are a subset of samadhi|Vocabulary: jhanas are a subset of samadhi]]_</span>

> [M]aybe most people, really need to forget the whole question that goes on: "Do I have it now? Is this it? Am I in a _jhāna_, or am I out of a _jhāna_ ?" And focus, rather, on enjoying, on just really maximizing your enjoyment... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#I might say "focus on maximizing your enjoyment"|I might say "focus on maximizing your enjoyment"]]_</span>

> I would like us to aim, or to think about 'mastering' each _jhāna_. What I mean by that is a few different components to that. I mean a really thorough familiarity with all the _jhānas_. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#"Mastery" is familiarity artistry and accessibility|"Mastery" is familiarity, artistry and accessibility]]_</span>

> I'm including in that meaning, really, a whole set of skills, a whole kind of artistry that's involved with regard to that _jhāna,_ in terms of working. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#"Mastery" is familiarity artistry and accessibility|"Mastery" is familiarity, artistry and accessibility]]_</span>

> We need to sit in a _jhāna_ a long time. It's doing a lot of work on the cells, on the being, on the _citta_. It's fine to go through for two seconds on the way - that's all fine, but the real work happens when we really just get in and sit there for a long time, and really let that change our habits, our mental habits, and our energetic habits. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; "marinate" in it|Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; "marinate" in it]]_</span>

> [I]f we go back to this idea that a _jhāna_ isn't really one thing - it's a territory. It's a realm. And like a lot of realms, it has different (as I said) flavours, aspects, regions, levels. And I can modulate, move between those different levels, and actually, eventually, also bring in other qualities to mix with it, like mixing cocktails. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Mastery also means that I can modulate|Mastery also means that I can modulate]]_</span>

> [D]on't erect a whole sign that "That's _the first_ jhāna." You say, "Okay, I think this is first _jhāna_, but let's just put a Post-it label now." &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Mastery also means that I can modulate|Mastery also means that I can modulate]]_</span>

> [T]he _jhānas_ - they're almost like dimensions of being, if you like. They're beautiful, amazing dimensions of being, treasures, treasure realms, enchanted realms. And they're there, and they're available for us. And this becomes a part of one's life, and a part of one's sense of what existence _is_ and what the cosmos includes. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being already there|Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being, already there]]_</span>

> [T]hey're like radio stations. They're in the air anyway. So it begins to be, it's not like I'm huffing and puffing to make this _jhāna_ happen. It's like they're _there_. And what we're doing is tuning to something that's already there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#That the realms already exists becomes obvious in the third jhana|That the realms already exists becomes obvious in the third jhana]]_</span>

> We want it to work on the being. We have to linger. We have to live there. We have to, as I said, marinate, absorb - not just _get_ absorbed, but almost absorb the _jhāna_ itself into our being, get to know it intimately, so that the cells, the mind, the habit patterns of mind, etc., and energy are affected. And in that way it makes a really long-term difference to one's life... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#No achievement badges|No achievement badges]]_</span>

> '[M]arinate' means a long time, and many times, in one _jhāna_. It's part of the mastery... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#"Marinate" means a long time and many times|"Marinate" means a long time, and many times]]_</span>

> [I]f there is an extraordinary opening to well-being or different kinds of well-being, if there's a really deep sense of different kinds of beauty, if there's a really profound sense of resource that's coming from that, if the practice of whatever it is you're doing brings, in an integrated way, insight and freedom, and it makes sense as part of the path in an integrated way, then _if_ we need to make definitions and demarcations, that would seem pretty good to call that a _jhāna_, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#A preliminary definition of what the jhana are|A preliminary definition of what the jhana are]]_</span>

> I can still say, "Okay, that's a _jhāna_," but I can still work on improving it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#A preliminary definition of what the jhana are|A preliminary definition of what the jhana are]]_</span>

> Does it make a difference if I keep the breath or my primary object? Some people say, "Absolutely. You can't let go of the primary object. If you're doing _jhāna_, you need to keep the breath. You need to keep the primary object." We'll see, actually, that you can do it both ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Can I develop a nose for what's primary what's secondary|Can I develop a nose for what's primary, what's secondary?]]_</span>

> [T]here are resources that come with the practice of the _jhānas_, that really enable, really help us to let go. We say, "Let go, let go, let go, let go." Once I'm this rich in this beauty, once I have these treasures available to me, it becomes much easier to let go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Once I have those treasures available to me it becomes much easier to let go|Once I have those treasures available to me it becomes much easier to let go]]_</span>

> _Jhānas_ alone will not liberate totally. But I want to say, nor will insight alone. Nor will both _jhānas_ and insight, the combination. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas alone will not liberate totally|Jhanas alone will not liberate totally]]_</span>

> [S]ensitivity, subtle attunement, refinement - you see, those same kind of developments are actually part of _jhāna_, emptiness, soulmaking, emotional work, healing, and relational stuff. There's something very integrated here. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhana practice can fit very naturally into other practices|Jhana practice can fit very naturally into other practices]]_</span>

> [A] person's emphasis or definition of a _jhāna_, of _jhāna_ practice, depends on their idea of what insight is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#A person's definition of jhana depends on their idea of what insight is|A person's definition of jhana depends on their idea of what insight is]]_</span>

> There's a relationship here between the way the goal is seen, the way insight is conceived of, the way _jhāna_ is conceived of, and then what we come to emphasize within _jhāna_ practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice|There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice]]_</span>

> [I]f I want a liberation that actually does have sensitivity in it, and attunement, and relational skill, and psychological awareness, and want to understand about emptiness as something very different, to do with ways of looking and fabrication, then I'm going to have to think about _jhānas_ in a very different way. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice|There's a relationship between the way the goal is seen and what I emphasize in jhana practice]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [T]he breath needs to get subtle, the mind needs to get subtle. The journey of _samādhi_, the journey into _jhānas_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your mind to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath (Instructions and Guided Meditation)#Samadhi is more about open-heartedness subtlety and refinement than focus|Samadhi is more about open-heartedness, subtlety and refinement than focus]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> Once the _jhānas,_ and even all eight _jhānas,_ are maybe accessible and regular visitors or explorations, etc. - even once all that is kind of up and running and going and wonderful, the hindrances will still arise at times. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#"With the abandoning of the hindrances there arises the first jhana"|"With the abandoning of the hindrances, there arises the first jhana"]]_</span>

> Are you in the _jhāna_ or are you out of the _jhāna_ ? It's an irrelevant question, 'in, out' - where's the intelligence here? The question is, what do I need to do at that point? What needs to happen? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Hindrances happen on a spectrum|Hindrances happen on a spectrum]]_</span>

> So it's not _really_ that the _jhāna_ is quite there, but something of a doorway to that, something of a trail of that _jhāna_ is there, and you can pick it up and just kind of point the mind there and dive into it... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#The jhanas are there anways you can point the mind to a peaceful level|The jhanas are there anways, you can point the mind to a peaceful level]]_</span>

> Hindrances - don't take them personally. They're a human thing. They're like facts of being human, and the arising of a hindrance doesn't mean anything about my capability as a meditator or my worthiness as a human being. That's really, really important. So, can I encourage that attitude? And that's part of where we want to move towards. That's part of the gift of _jhāna_ practice. We begin, after a while, to see: it's not personal. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#3 Do not take the hindrances personally they are a fact of being human|(3) Do not take the hindrances personally, they are a fact of being human]]_</span>

> [T]he view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhānas_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real I'm not parking in either one|I can see an emotion as empty or see it as real, I'm not parking in either one]]_</span>

> So, over a long time of _jhāna_ practice, there is this movement of shaving away the gross, getting down to the hindrances, and then even more subtle. But they stay. They're part of the deal. And we need to be okay with that, really up for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[A Hidden Treasure - The Relationship with the Hindrances#Over time self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance|Over time, self-view manifest less as papanca and more as pure hindrance]]_</span>
