### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> [R]eally putting a lot of time, energy, effort into cultivating a heart of loving-kindness. Then that's there in the heart, it's a quality that's a frequent guest in the heart. That makes a huge difference, because kindness is a quality that brings happiness, it brings happiness. A heart of metta is a happy heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#A heart of metta is a happy heart|A heart of metta is a happy heart]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or grief, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a beauty to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that energy that's going out - the lovely quality of healing, of light, the balm, the comforting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy|(2) Wanting to heal the suffering (energy)]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Mindfulness, when there's mindfulness, attentiveness, presence, with curiosity and the curiosity of investigation, that can be there, and a kind of energy with that, that we're injecting some energy into that. That brings joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Mindfulness i e the its energy brings joy|Mindfulness (i.e. the its energy) brings joy]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**

> It's an energy that one can actually ride and navigate.

<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And putting the awareness, just gently keep putting it other places - belly, heart centre, etc. And the more you do that with that sensitivity, the more the energy, the more the awareness kind of rests there, takes its centre there. And then it can radiate from there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head|Keep putting the awareness in other places than the head]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Again, you can experiment with this. We feel the empathy. We're aware of the empathy, what we're taking in. We're tuning into the suffering. But also we're aware of this - even if we're just imagining it - a healing energy going out. And we imagine that energy flowing from our body, etc. So there's something coming in and something going out. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Balance this with a healing energy 2 giving out|Balance this with a healing energy (2) giving out]]_</span>

> [A] little bit of balance towards the feeling of the loveliness and the happiness makes compassion enjoyable, sustainable, steady, equanimous, something that we like doing. And we need to kind of feel that energy in the body, that energy going, or even just imagine it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#You can play with this it's not a static balance|You can play with this, it's not a static balance]]_</span>

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving|Recap: balancing of receiving and giving]]_</span>

<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>

> It's part of the whole kind of energetic awareness we want to gradually cultivate, this bubble of resource.

> Energization through the whole space with the in-breath; a kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath. Qualities of energy that fill the whole space with the in-and the out-breaths. So this is what we want to tune to, open to, really feel. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#A kind of relaxation easing letting go with the out-breath|A kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath]]_</span>

It's more than just the space of awareness.
