### Quotes

<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> [R]eally putting a lot of time, energy, effort into cultivating a heart of loving-kindness. Then that's there in the heart, it's a quality that's a frequent guest in the heart. That makes a huge difference, because kindness is a quality that brings happiness, it brings happiness. A heart of metta is a happy heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#A heart of metta is a happy heart|A heart of metta is a happy heart]]_</span>

**[[Love and Emptiness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> There's nowhere outside of acceptance. There's nowhere outside of love. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-acceptance, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the love, the space of love, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the kindness, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Relaxing back into a space of metta|Relaxing back into a space of metta]]_</span>

> Mind always has some mind state. So with [mindfulness](app://obsidian.md/mindfulness), there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#But the mind is coloroud with anger metta romantic love|But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love]]_</span>

> So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation|Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation]]_</span>

> So it's just whatever's in consciousness, whatever's prominent, there the mettā goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight aversion here. And it's clear, and then the mettā comes in or the compassion or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and Emptiness#Rob Both sensible and you'll get very quick at doing it either way|Rob: Both sensible, and you'll get very quick at doing it either way]]_</span>

**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So this practice that we've been doing this week, with directing kindness towards things, and sometimes the things fade - one actually sees that, through the lack of kindness or the lack of acceptance, a perception is actually getting built, it's getting fabricated or compounded, to use the Buddha's words, constructed in the moment. Without the mind doing something, that perception cannot be there. So something, whatever's going on, is just a perception. It's just fabricated. It's empty, in other words. It's empty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Practice seeing things as just perceptions|Practice: seeing things as just perceptions]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So these practices, loving-kindness and compassion, are really dwellings for the heart: the heart, the being, the consciousness dwells in a space, in an inner space, of beauty, of sublimity, of something that feels divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places|Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places]]_</span>

> This is a very fluid, very responsive practice. One of the skills in _samādhi_ practice, one of the skills in _mettā_ practice, is responsiveness. So what is the way of using the phrases or leaving the phrases that's most helpful right now for you? That's it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Your need for the phrases changes|Your need for the phrases changes]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> And this is partly why we keep encouraging this sensitivity that's developed in your practice, particularly sensitivity to the body, and just actually _allowing_ the _mettā_ to take these subtly different flavours, at times. Sometimes, when it has that feeling, to go through that, and really just allowing that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's more a constellation of feelings|It's more a constellation of feelings]]_</span>

> So _mettā_ in its aspiration is: it doesn't matter what you do, what you give me back, what you say, whether you're grateful, what you've done, whether I like you - none of that. It's unconditional. But usually, there are strings and conditions attached to our love, and it's actually attached love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Near enemy of metta is attached love|Near enemy of metta is attached love]]_</span>

> There's self, and there's effort involved, and the phrases, and we're creating this _mettā_. But again, talking about aspects of _mettā_, facets of _mettā_, it's not always like that. And there are other ways that it can reveal itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#It's not always that metta feels it's coming from the self|It's not always that metta feels it's coming from the self]]_</span>

> What was needed was very clearly a pure embrace of loving-kindness, breathing to expand the capacity of accepting the unacceptable and relax. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Embrace pain lovingly|Embrace pain lovingly]]_</span>

**[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [L]ove and fear have this kind of inverse relationship. Originally, the Buddha offered the _mettā_ practice to a group of monks who were really, really afraid in the forest. That was his initial offering as an antidote and as a response to fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Fear is an aversion that blocks love|Fear is an aversion that blocks love]]_</span>

> And our life involves an incredible amount of uncertainty and change. That's the nature, that's the fabric of our existence. And they, like us, are subject to that. So just holding this lightly, this sense of _anicca_ that they are vulnerable to, holding that in the awareness very lightly, as one's doing the _mettā_, can either kick-start the _mettā_ when it feels like it's a little bit blocked or it can't really get off the ground... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#a Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life|a) Remembering death and the unpredicatibility of life]]_</span>

> So you kind of make them somewhat empty, but not completely empty, so you've still got a sense of somewhere you can direct the _mettā_ towards. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 You can play with how formed you make someone|(2) You can play with how formed you make someone]]_</span>

> _[M]ettā_ is not a technique. We're interested in technique, but what we're interested in is finding the technique and the approach that works for you. If, for the most part, that means no words, you're not alone in that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#You don't have to keep trundling the phrases out|You don't have to keep trundling the phrases out]]_</span>

> [I]t may be that you can find a place where it's okay, and actually just radiate the _mettā_ from there, or feel the _mettā_ from there. And eventually, it washes over everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#2 put attention elsewhere|(2) put attention elsewhere]]_</span>

> Cultivating, developing, reinforcing - remember these habit pattern things we keep talking about. You get a record in a groove.

> You can actually be in the practice, doing the _mettā_ or the compassion - bring this in. Think about Big Bangs, and think about stardust and the way the breath is permeable.

We can _hold_ it in compassion, _hold_ it in love, or _let_ it be held in that water of love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#Recap guided meditation directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience|Recap guided meditation: directing the stream of loving-kindness and compassion towards experience]]_</span>

> When the mind, when the heart, is small, restricted, that karma ripens - the memory of what we did, or what happened to us or whatever - ripens in that context of the restricted, the constricted heart. In the unrestricted heart, the immeasurable heart - so one that is either immeasurable through loving-kindness and compassion, or joy or equanimity, one of the _brahmavihāras_, immeasurable that way, or unrestricted through _samādhi_ or through insight - in the unrestricted heart, when that karma ripens, when it comes up, when the memory comes up or the effects from the past come up, memory or otherwise, it's in a very different context. And the Buddha said it will barely be noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Ripening of karma from the past|Ripening of karma from the past]]_</span>

> That's what wisdom or insight or _paññā_ means: we're understanding the causes and conditions that lead to suffering. And out of that very understanding is born compassion. That very understanding will bring with it compassion. So one could never go anywhere near loving-kindness practice or compassion practice, and just the deepening of the insight will bring compassion naturally, effortlessly, organically, because we're going into the causes and conditions and _understanding_ that. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering|Compassion is borne out of the understanding of the causes and conditions of suffering]]_</span>
