### Quotes
**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or grief, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a beauty to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that energy that's going out - the lovely quality of healing, of light, the balm, the comforting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#2 Wanting to heal the suffering energy|(2) Wanting to heal the suffering (energy)]]_</span>

**[[What is Insight]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> Something very beautiful, very precious, and extremely important about just giving attention, just coming back, just being here, just being mindful, devoting oneself to that - a preciousness and beauty in that way of being, way of practicing, and trusting that out of that, the insights will come. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[What is Insight#Impermanence is an obvious fact but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference|Impermanence is an obvious fact, but are we seeing it in a way that makes a difference?]]_</span>

**[[Joy (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 New Years Retreat Insight Meditation]]</span>
> So it's joy that comes from cultivation of the beautiful qualities of heart; joy that comes from appreciation, cultivating appreciation; joy that comes from opening, from connecting, from perceiving beauty, from developing our capacity to perceive beauty, from the deepening of our practice, joy in practice itself, joy in the Dharma, joy in the teachings, in hearing the teachings, in the Saṅgha, in the community of people who love to practise, who are interested in practising. This is all Dharma joy, spiritual joy. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself|Different ways spiritual joy expresses itself]]_</span>

> And I remember sitting there and sort of taking in the whole beauty of the life unfolding. And of course what was very much absent was this critical, "Right. Wrong. That wasn't quite good enough," etc. And such joy and delight and appreciation of just the beauty of humanity sort of coming together, and living, and life just manifesting. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Joy (talk)#Contrast relaxed listening to an Arabic music concert|Contrast: relaxed listening to an Arabic music concert]]_</span>

**[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> You know, sometimes you want to be a bit more inner, and it's appropriate to be with one's own experience. But other times, open up. Can there be an appreciation of the beauty of what's going on here and the loveliness of everyone practising together, trying together, supporting each other, in the silence, in the schedule, and all that? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#There are many things to appreciate|There are many things to appreciate]]_</span>

> So these practices, loving-kindness and compassion, are really dwellings for the heart: the heart, the being, the consciousness dwells in a space, in an inner space, of beauty, of sublimity, of something that feels divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Place of Samadhi in Metta Practice#Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places|Our mind is often dwelling in unhelpful places]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Walking, walking meditation, and the foot touches the earth, and actually, there can be a kiss there. There can be love, somehow felt, tenderness, beauty felt, between foot and earth. This is available to us, something we can explore, something we can play with. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness#Explore a tenderness of touch for ourselves|Explore a tenderness of touch for ourselves]]_</span>

**[[Love and the Emptiness of Things]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> "I won't put the pole here; I'll keep going, keep the questioning alive," until one has totally understood this dependent arising and how anything at all - no matter how beautiful, how subtle, how refined, how seemingly ultimate - comes to be. And that doesn't mean dismissing everything as just conditions, and it's just all irrelevant. It doesn't mean that at all, because one also opens to the Unconditioned and the beauty of what that means as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Love and the Emptiness of Things#To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened|To understand fully the nature of perception is to be fully awakened]]_</span>

**[[Questioning Awakening]]**
<span class="counts">[[2014 November Solitary - Questioning Awakening]]</span>
> Is there not, in the way that you feel and relate to practice, a whole kind of mythos, a whole kind of ethos, a whole particular kind of beauty that you relate to, that speaks to you, that touches your soul? Wrapped up in that, a whole way of seeing existence? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for|It's not just the reduction of suffering we are here for]]_</span>

**[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> It doesn't open that up. It doesn't nourish it. It doesn't bring water to it. It doesn't fan the fire. It doesn't bring out the beauty, reveal the beauty, the dimensions there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Way of Non-Clinging Part 3#Certain viewpoints cannot fan the fire|Certain viewpoints cannot fan the fire]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [W]henever there is a sense of soulfulness, that kind of richness, resonance, depth, dimensionality, beauty, meaningfulness, in our existence, in the being, whenever there is soulmaking, sacredness in our existence, eros is involved. Eros is involved whenever there is soulmaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#Eros involves energy embodiment the imaginal and logos|Eros involves energy, embodiment, the imaginal, and logos]]_</span>

> '[C]linging,' and all the subtleties and the beauties of working with that in practice: letting go of clinging, moving up and down the spectrum of clinging, and seeing what it does to the fabrication of the perception of self, other, world, time, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 1#It also fits with emptiness teachings|It also fits with emptiness teachings]]_</span>

**[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2017 Eros Unfettered]]</span>
> [E]ros leads, brings, stimulates, opens a perception of - more and more so, in fact, as it goes on - a perception of the beauty and the divinity. More and more, as I said, this grows, the divinity of the object, of the erotic object. Eros opens the perception of beauty and divinity, and we can't help but love what appears to us deeply beautiful and divine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Dilemmas and Delineations - How did we get here Part 4#But it's not possible to have eros without love|But it's not possible to have eros without love]]_</span>

**[[Daimon, Refracted]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Four Circles, Four Parables of Stone and Light]]</span>
> We have all kinds of reasons and social taboos and cultural conditionings and whatnot, and contractions of being, and psychology - it's harder to have that, to recognize the beauty and the dimensionality, and to have an erotic relationship with oneself. So one kind of externalizes it by just making it image. Don't worry if it's not imaginal at first. It can very soon _become_ imaginal, more fully imaginal, with the eros there. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that|Sometimes it's easier to have that sense of beauty and eros when it's externalized like that]]_</span>

> So sometimes connecting with an image and recognizing, feeling, opening to its love for us, it's so tailored and so tailored to our being and our particularities, and so attuned to us and empowered by the dimensionality and the divinity and the beauty, etc., that, in a way, that kind of love, the love that images have for us, that profound and almost mysterious, mysteriously attuned love, it can heal the inner critic and that whole painful constellation almost more powerfully, I think, than anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Daimon, Refracted#The love images have for us can heal the inner critic|The love images have for us can heal the inner critic]]_</span>

**[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [G]o for a walk out there, off the grounds, with the idea of enjoying yourself, and opening the heart, taking in the beauty, appreciating, opening the senses, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Counting Within the Breath (Guided Meditation)#Go for walks|Go for walks]]_</span>

**[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> The onus is on you to be responsive and sensitive to your practice, and the needs, and the ebbs and flows, and the ups and downs, and "What is needed right now? Do I need to go out and do some walking? Do I need to sit longer with whatever is happening? Do I need to actually go for a walk, and open my mind, and touch the beauty, and be touched by beauty? Do I need a cup of tea?" &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#"Open schedule" means that it's on you to find a working temporal structure|"Open schedule" means that it's on you to find a working temporal structure]]_</span>

> '[F]antasy' as opposed to 'image.' They're almost subliminal. They're just kind of really nourishing and supporting, lubricating our whole sense of what we're doing, giving moisture there, giving beauty and depth. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#There fantasies operate in the background|There fantasies operate in the background]]_</span>

**[[An Introduction to the Jhanas]]**
<span class="counts">[[2019 Practising the Jhanas]]</span>
> [I]f there is an extraordinary opening to well-being or different kinds of well-being, if there's a really deep sense of different kinds of beauty, if there's a really profound sense of resource that's coming from that, if the practice of whatever it is you're doing brings, in an integrated way, insight and freedom, and it makes sense as part of the path in an integrated way, then _if_ we need to make definitions and demarcations, that would seem pretty good to call that a _jhāna_, right? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#A preliminary definition of what the jhana are|A preliminary definition of what the jhana are]]_</span>

> [T]here are resources that come with the practice of the _jhānas_, that really enable, really help us to let go. We say, "Let go, let go, let go, let go." Once I'm this rich in this beauty, once I have these treasures available to me, it becomes much easier to let go. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Once I have those treasures available to me it becomes much easier to let go|Once I have those treasures available to me it becomes much easier to let go]]_</span>

> It's something about opening more and more, or to more and more of the beauty, the beauties of existence, inner and outer. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#Jhanas there's something of magic here|Jhanas: there's something of magic here]]_</span>

> Yes, definitely, we _do_ want to increase and develop our focus and our concentration. But we also, and oftentimes more importantly, are interested in this development of deep, profound resources, of training the perceptions (what does that mean?), the relation of that with emptiness understanding, and the development of all these lovely, lovely capacities and capabilities of attunement, sensitivity, subtlety of awareness, beauty, magic, art. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[An Introduction to the Jhanas#We are interested in the development of deep profound resources|We are interested in the development of deep, profound resources]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> And then, again, in terms of consequences, one of the beautiful consequences - this is part of what we don't know, in terms of when we really act in line with the [[duty]] of our [[soul]] and the callings of our soul, we can't always know the [[beauty]] and the fruit that comes out of that act. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4#African American residents boycotted the public bus service|African American residents boycotted the public bus service]]_</span>
