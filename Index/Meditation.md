**[[Equanimity in Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> So again, in Dharma practice as well, what will my life be like if I don't take care of the kind of intentions I have in life, of the kind of actions, of the kind of speech, of cultivating what is beautiful? How will I be in twenty, thirty years if I'm still alive? What will have happened to the heart? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#How will my life be if I don't cultivate what is beautiful|How will my life be if I don't cultivate what is beautiful?]]_</span>

**[[Exploring the World of Loving Kindness]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> Walking, walking meditation, and the foot touches the earth, and actually, there can be a kiss there. There can be love, somehow felt, tenderness, beauty felt, between foot and earth.

**[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen we talk about compassion in the meditation, there's the taking in, the empathy, the tuning into the suffering of another, letting the heart resonate, letting that sorrow resonate in the heart, the receiving of the suffering. And the balancing of that with the healing energy that goes out, the balm, that which soothes, that which helps. And feeling that energy on its way out, the balm, the healing, because it bathes oneself on the way out, and it's actually pleasant, and it's actually happy, even if it's just quietly happy, and it's actually nourishing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Birth of a Bodhisattva#Recap balancing of receiving and giving|Recap: balancing of receiving and giving]]_</span>

Big difference in what is meant. If you mean matter, what is it that you mean by matter? {quote If you mean appearances, there's nothing beyond appearances, again, what exactly do you mean? And do you understand, through meditation, the dependent arising and the dependent fading and cessation of all appearances, so that there can be a beyond this, a beyond appearances? This is available in meditation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Questioning Awakening#"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"|"There is nothing beyond this" - what do you mean with "this"?]]_</span>
