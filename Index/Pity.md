### Quotes
**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [Compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) is something that's actually energizing and healing, and moves towards the alleviation of suffering. Self-pity will just keep it cycling. It's disempowering. It actually _keeps_ suffering there. Compassion to self and other is empowering and not debilitating. So in the practice, you can see: when has pity crept in, and is there some way I can equalize things again? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#Self-pity is disempowering|Self-pity is disempowering]]_</span>
