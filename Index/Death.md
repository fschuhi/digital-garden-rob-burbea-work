### Quotes
**[[Equanimity (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2006 New Year's Retreat]]</span>
> This right now, this sound, this sight, these body sensations, it's all in the context of .. the vast unknown of death. So in a way can we contemplate the infinite every day, can we contemplate death every day. Not morbid. Maybe a little scary at first but actually moving towards equanimity, moving towards freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity (talk)#This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death|This moment is in the context of vast time and the vast unknown of death]]_</span>

**[[From Insight to Love]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> This moment here - colour, light, sound - is in the context of death and that kind of vastness. Can you get a sense of the moment through that lens? &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[From Insight to Love#This moment here is in the context of death|This moment here is in the context of death]]_</span>

> They are also subject not just to death but to the uncertainty and change that is, in a way, woven into the fabric of the moment of our lives.

And again, instead of unlocking fear, sometimes it can unlock more love. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Using Insight to Deepen Love and Compassion#Put the moment of perception into context of the unknown|Put the moment of perception into context of the unknown]]_</span>

**[[Compassion (talk)]]**
<span class="counts">[[2008 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> The body is vulnerable. We are vulnerable to death. Reflecting, we are one in that. We share that. There's a oneness there. We are one in our uncertainty. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Compassion (talk)#Incline the mind towards oneness|Incline the mind towards oneness]]_</span>
