**[[The Practice of Compassion]]**
<span class="counts">[[2007 Lovingkindness and Compassion As a Path to Awakening]]</span>
> [W]hen the [compassion](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Compassion) has gone off into righteous anger or we feel that kind of anger come in, it's actually painful for us. So sometimes this might happen in the course of your practice, if you're giving compassion to the difficult person. To take a moment and just give the compassion to oneself, recognizing there's some pain there. If I'm involved in judgment, if I'm involved in blame, in anger, in all that, my heart is burning, my heart is [contracted](https://publish.obsidian.md/rob-burbea/Index/Contraction) and painful. Just to take a moment, and turn round, and feel that pain, and touch it with compassion to oneself, and then to go out again. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Practice of Compassion#When feeling the pain of anger coming in remember to give compassion to yourself|When feeling the pain of anger coming in, remember to give compassion to yourself]]_</span>

> Oftentimes with our own suffering, we're actually adding to the suffering by sort of adding an extra layer of isolation, and we don't even realize that we're doing it.

> But sometimes it can be just the sense of contraction is a sense of suffering. And one notices that when there's pushing or pulling or aversion, there's suffering there. As I relax that, the suffering goes. And being actually sensitive to the suffering and the release of suffering is really key in the deepening of equanimity. So there's a real sensitivity to suffering and its release, and suffering and its release, and suffering and its release, as the process deepens... &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[Equanimity in Compassion#Rob feeling the suffering is important because there's a lot insight in this approach|Rob: feeling the suffering is important because there's a lot insight in this approach]]_</span>

> So in the whole space, attuned, alive, filled with awareness; the longest breath. Just how does it feel, the expansion and the contraction with the breath?

> **(1) the expansion and contraction of the whole space**. Not just your ribcage, but the whole space, and it feels a certain way. **(2)** Second thing: **the energization and relaxation, again, that you can feel in the whole space**. **(3)** The third aspect, actually, which we'll pick up again, is the possibility that, **within that whole space, you notice certain currents of energy**. &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="counts">_[[The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#Recap; three kinds of things to pay attention to|Recap; three kinds of things to pay attention to]]_</span>

**[[Preliminaries Regarding Voice, Movement, and Gesture - Part 4]]**
<span class="counts">[[2020 Vajra Music]]</span>
> Because when there's sensing with soul, it will tend to counter that kind of reified and [[Contraction|contracted]] [[The Self|self-consciousness]], self-obsession, because that's not really a soul-movement. It may be a kind of squeezed, impoverished reflection of what's, if you like, originally a soul-movement, but in itself, it's not.
