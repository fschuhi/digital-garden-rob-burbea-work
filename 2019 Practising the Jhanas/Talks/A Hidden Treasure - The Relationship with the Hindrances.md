Don't judge, just: "What does it feel like? Oh, it's _dukkha_." And feel the pain of it. I just have to let my consciousness touch the pain there.

```ad-quote
Instead of the automatic, natural aversion to the hindrances, I'm actually saying, "Come, come, I'll take this." But it has heart in it. It has this, "I'm willing to take this suffering right now. I'm opening myself to the suffering for the sake of the release from suffering of someone else, somewhere." So it's a kind of, you could say, 'magical thinking' - it doesn't matter - using your imagination, whatever.

there's something in the way I'm seeing this and relating to this actually really lovely thing, and I'm somehow spinning it with a negative - I'm seeing it through a negative lens. This is incredibly common, and it's what we might call, like, a really deep, deep, almost base-level _kilesa,_ defilement, of aversion in the mind.

I recognize that peacefulness. And you point the mind, and you just dive underneath a little bit. It's there. And then I'm tuning to that. I'm not getting caught up. Yes, this part of the body doesn't feel quite connected, or feels a bit constricted, or the mind - so I'm just pointing to that, I dive into it, and then what's my work there? I've dived in. Now I'm in touch with that peacefulness. Now what? Now I need to work with that, get into it, enjoy it, open to it, focus on it

this development of subtlety and refinement and discrimination - that also happens in regard to the hindrances. In terms of our overall trajectory, this recognition and working with the subtlety of the spectrum of the hindrance is also part of that whole development of subtlety. Yes, it's much nicer, attuning and discerning to subtle differences of _this_ kind of exquisite peacefulness versus _that_ kind of exquisite peacefulness, but in terms of developing the whole subtlety - which again, is so important for our emotional life and all the rest of it - that's important too. It's all subtlety. It's all discrimination. It's all attunement.

Without me _doing_ something, usually unconsciously, it cannot arise as that emotion. It cannot get fabricated. It cannot get constructed. So in the Buddha's words, we "see a hindrance as a hindrance,"^[Cf. the Buddha's statement at DN 22: "One dwells seeing phenomena as phenomena in terms of the five hindrances" _(dhammesu dhammﾄ］upassﾄｫ viharati paﾃｱcasu nﾄｫvara盪esu)_] and not necessarily as an emotion. We recognize what's there. It's a 'fabrication,' or in other language, it's actually 'empty.'

the view of catharsis, the view of, "Yes, something is purifying here. I may not even know what, but I sit through it as a purification," and then I have a whole stance with that and relationship with it - or the view that "It's _not_ that. They're fabrications, and I need to get interested in the fabrication." They're both there. But as we practise certainly _jhﾄ］as_ more and more, we begin to "see a hindrance as a hindrance" more and more, as the Buddha might say.

So over time, there's this kind of sifting away, filtering away of the more _papaﾃｱcizing_ element of the mind. And it becomes: "It's just the hindrance." It might still be quite strong; I'm really quite restless in the body, but there's no story attached to it. There's no lostness. What was usually _papaﾃｱca_ becomes more just, "I'm just dealing with a hindrance now."
```

```ad-quote
So, over a long time of _jhﾄ］a_ practice, there is this movement of shaving away the gross, getting down to the hindrances, and then even more subtle. But they stay. They're part of the deal. And we need to be okay with that, really up for that.
