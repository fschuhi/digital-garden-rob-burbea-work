It's not that we're not interested in the rest of your life, but part of the supporting conditions, we're really kind of containing the content of the interviews.

```

```ad-quote
It's part of the whole kind of energetic awareness we want to gradually cultivate, this bubble of resource. So find that pace where actually that's what you're doing when you're moving around - you've got some sense of the whole body, and the energy of the whole body.
