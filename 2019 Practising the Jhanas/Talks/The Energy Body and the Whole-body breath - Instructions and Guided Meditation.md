### Whole body, energy body
##### Today more about the energy body, working with the whole-body breath
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Awareness]] · [[Energy Body]] (4) · [[Breath]] · [[Samadhi]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=02:09]]

```ad-quote
Energy body is a big subject, and it's actually quite hard to sum it up in a sort of pithy sentence. It's a concept that grows, that's elastic, that has all kinds of avenues to it.
```

---
##### "Whole body" = your felt sense of the physical space of the body (actually a bit bigger)
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (9) · [[Retreat]] · [[Attention]] · [[Awareness]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=03:05]]

---
##### "Energy body" is the vibration, texture, feeling, energy of the whole body space
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^1-6|1-6]]**: _[[Energy Body]] · [[Energy]] (3) · [[Mahasi Sayadaw]] (2) · [[Retreat]] · [[Breath]] · [[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Attention]] (2) · [[Experience]] · [[Dominant Culture]] · [[Meditation]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=04:08]]

```ad-quote
Certainly in our wider culture, it's like, "What do you _mean_ when you say 'vibration,' 'texture,' 'feeling,' 'energy'?" We're not trained with the kind of quality or poise of attention that reveals that kind of realm or stratum of experience.
```

---
##### Vague terms, but pointing in a certain direction
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[Energy]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=06:06]]

---
##### The sense of the body is integrated
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^2-2|2-2]]**: _[[Energy Body]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] (4) · [[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Jhanas]] · [[Experience]] (2)_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=06:30]]

```ad-quote
It really feels like one body area, one realm or one texture of experience.
```

---
##### Homogeneity, of experience but also of awareness
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Experience]] (2) · [[Awareness]] (3) · [[Embodiment]] · [[Energy Body]] · [[Samadhi]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=07:26]]

```ad-quote
the awareness inhabits equally, homogenously, the whole space, and even a little bit bigger. So the whole thing is integrated and homogenized.
```

---
##### Samadhi practice is coaxing the energy body into something nice
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Meditation]] · [[Energy Body]] (4) · [[Samadhi]] (3) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Experience]] · [[Desire]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=09:00]]

```ad-quote
There's a directionality and a desire there.
```

---
##### Sensitivity to temperature
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[Energy Body]] · [[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=09:48]]

---
##### Experiment, be careful of that inertia
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Personhood]] · [[Inertia]] · [[Energy Body]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=11:09]]

```ad-quote
We're always interested in what helps the energy body experience. It's this ongoing experiment. What helps? Check. Know yourself. You have to be willing to experiment with something like this.
```

---
### Guided meditation
##### Really find in your posture that balance between uprightness and receptivity
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^3-5|3-5]]**: _[[Attention]] · [[Receptivity]] · [[Mind]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=12:22]]

```ad-quote
We need to get it in the groove, and then, actually, you'll feel that affect your mind. So it's worth taking the trouble. Even if you've been meditating for thirty years, it's worth just finding that.
```

---
##### Can you make the posture it a little bit more open?
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^3-6|3-6]]**: _[[Nobility]] · [[Citta]] (3) · [[Receptivity]] · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=13:35]]

```ad-quote
Can you make it a little bit more open, a little bit more soft right now? What would you change?
```

---
##### Feel the beauty of the posture, then open up the awareness to include the whole body
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^3-7|3-7]]**: _[[Beauty]] · [[Awareness]] · [[Embodiment]] (2)_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=15:03]]

```ad-quote
Inhabit the whole space. Bright, alive sensitivity permeating, pervading that whole space.
```

---
##### We are interested in the felt sense, not so much the image of the physical form
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^3-8|3-8]]**: _[[Image]] (2) · [[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Emptiness]] · [[Awareness]] (2)_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=16:20]]

```ad-quote
So the awareness will keep shrinking. It will shrink a thousand times. And just keep opening it out to just a little bit bigger than the physical body space, and fill that with alive awareness, presence.
```

---
##### Notice how the breath affects the felt sense of the whole body space
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (3) · [[Awareness]] (2) · [[Breath]] (4)_</span>

##### Establish the longest, comfortable breath
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[Breath]] (4) · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=18:45]]

```ad-note

```

---
##### The whole space is expanding on the in-breath, contracting on the out-breath
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Breath]] (3) · [[Awareness]] · [[Contraction]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=20:10]]

```ad-note
in-breath
```

```ad-quote
So in the whole space, attuned, alive, filled with awareness; the longest breath. Just how does it feel, the expansion and the contraction with the breath? Really tuning to that and feeling it.
```

---
##### Keep opening the space to the whole body
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-4|4-4]]**: _[[Breath]] (2) · [[Attention]] (2) · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=22:45]]

---
##### The in-breath energizes the whole space
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[Breath]] (4) · [[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Awareness]] (2) · [[Experience]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=25:00]]

```ad-quote
Can you feel it right to the edges of the space, the whole body? Can you tune to, even enjoy, open to, this experience, the sense, the feeling of energization with the in-breath?
```

---
##### A kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-6|4-6]]**: _[[Breath]] (3) · [[Letting go]] (2) · [[Energy]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=26:25]]

```ad-quote
Energization through the whole space with the in-breath; a kind of relaxation, easing, letting go with the out-breath. Qualities of energy that fill the whole space with the in-and the out-breaths. So this is what we want to tune to, open to, really feel.
```

---
##### Letting the breath energy open the body
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-7|4-7]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Breath]] (3) · [[Energy]] (2) · [[Attention]] · [[Awareness]]_</span>

##### Imagine the breath coming into the body at the solar plexus
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^4-8|4-8]]**: _[[Breath]] (6) · [[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Contraction]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=31:05]]

```ad-quote
Just imagine it coming in at the solar plexus. That's, maybe, even a kinaesthetic imagination.
```

---
##### Maybe there is a double current of energy, going up and down
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Breath]] (6) · [[Embodiment]] (10) · [[Energy]] (2) · [[Attention]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=32:40]]

```ad-quote
Can you imagine the feeling, a kinaesthetic imagination, the breath coming in at the solar plexus, and currents going simultaneously in opposite directions, up the body and down the body? Just play.
```

---
##### What length of breath feels best right now?
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (2) · [[Breath]] (6)_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=36:15]]

```ad-quote
So is it keeping this really longest breath? Is it a very short breath? Is it somewhere in between? Is it a kind of very, very subtle breath, or a grosser breath? Smooth or coarse? What feels best right now? What way of breathing feels best right now? You have to experiment.
```

---
##### Not just the default - play, experiment
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Breath]] (4) · [[Embodiment]] (3)_</span>

##### Bringing sensitivity to the whole space
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=40:40]]

### Recap
##### Recap; three kinds of things to pay attention to
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^5-7|5-7]]**: _[[Jhanas]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Meditation]] · [[Breath]] · [[Attention]] · [[Contraction]] · [[Energy]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=42:17]]

```ad-quote
**(1) the expansion and contraction of the whole space**. Not just your ribcage, but the whole space, and it feels a certain way. **(2)** Second thing: **the energization and relaxation, again, that you can feel in the whole space**. **(3)** The third aspect, actually, which we'll pick up again, is the possibility that, **within that whole space, you notice certain currents of energy**.
```

---
##### Also what way of breathing feels good right now
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^6-1|6-1]]**: _[[Breath]] · [[Healing]] · [[Samadhi]] · [[Inertia]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=43:50]]

```ad-quote
So often, we just go into a default breath, and the only reason it feels comfortable is just because we're used to it. At that moment, it may well _not_ be that helpful in terms of really energizing, and opening, and healing, and soothing, and moving towards _samādhi_. So we have to be, again, willing to let go of our inertia, if it's there.
```

---
##### Samadhi is more about open-heartedness, subtlety and refinement than focus
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Breath]] (3) · [[Samadhi]] (4) · [[Mind]] (2) · [[Jhanas]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=44:39]]

```ad-quote
the breath needs to get subtle, the mind needs to get subtle. The journey of _samādhi_, the journey into _jhānas_, is a journey into increasing refinement and subtlety, and we could say it's more _that_ than it is into increasing ability to nail your mind to something and stay there all day, or whatever it is.
```

---
##### We want a sensitivity that permeates the whole space
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Breath]] (5) · [[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Inertia]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=44:36]]

```ad-quote
Sensitivity, responsiveness, and willingness to experiment and play.
```

```ad-quote
As we go on, and get more and more, and deeper and deeper, those same qualities - sensitivity, responsivity, and willingness - start to apply to more and more aspects of the whole movement of _samādhi_ and the deepening of _samādhi_.
```

---
##### Simile: riding a bike with gears; improvised dance
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Breath]] (3) · [[Music]] (2) · [[Love]] · [[Experience]] · [[Energy]] · [[Inertia]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=47:56]]

---
### Outro
##### During the day, aim for a whole-body awareness that is quite relaxed and open
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Embodiment]] (5) · [[Awareness]] (5) · [[Energy Body]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Attention]] (5)_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=49:05]]

```ad-quote
If you can get a sense, it's like the space feels relaxed. It's not heavy, intense attention. Intense attention has its place, and we'll talk about that - the energization of attention. But what I'm really talking about as we move around is a kind of open, easeful attention, and an open, easeful body, and they go together.
```

---
##### Again, the seed question: what helps?
<span class="counts">**[[1218 The Energy Body and the Whole-body breath - Instructions and Guided Meditation#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Energy Body]] · [[Attention]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-the_energy_body_and_the_whole_body_breath_instructions_and_guided_meditation-60884.mp3#t=51:09]]

```ad-quote
That kind of relationship, that kind of state of energy body awareness. What kind of stance or pressure do I have to have? Do I need to kind of loosen off and relax a little bit, or actually do I need to bring and cohere my attention a bit more? So always there's a question, and the question invites us into this playfulness, responsiveness, sensitivity - the whole deal.
```
