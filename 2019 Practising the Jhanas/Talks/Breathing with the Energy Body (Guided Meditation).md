And really not a lot of air. It's really quite a gentle, subtle breath, relatively speaking. A long, slow, smooth breath, in and out. And alive to the whole body space, the whole energy body.

feel into the sense of the whole space being energized, feeling energized with the in-breath, and a kind of relaxation or letting go with the out-breath.

### Q&A
##### Anything is possible with regard to breathing with the energy body
<span class="counts">**[[1219 Breathing with the Energy Body (Guided Meditation)#^3-9|3-9]]**: _[[Meditation]] · [[Juiciness]] · [[Breath]] · [[Embodiment]] (2)_</span>

##### Energy body coupled with breath is a huge playground
<span class="counts">**[[1219 Breathing with the Energy Body (Guided Meditation)#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Energy body]] (3) · [[Breath]] (4) · [[Contraction]]_</span>

![[20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-breathing_with_the_energy_body_guided_meditation-60862.mp3#t=39:17]]

##### You are using the breath to feel good

```ad-quote
And what you're paying attention to is what feels good, what's helpful in terms of - remember the Buddha's analogy of the soap ball, and the apprentice bathman, bathperson, just shaping it. That's kind of what you're doing. You're using the breath to shape that ball into what feels good.

##### Metta might be an ingredient

![[20191219-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-breathing_with_the_energy_body_guided_meditation-60862.mp3#t=41:49]]

```ad-quote
I think if you want to go deep in _mettā_, you probably want to eventually separate it from the breath, okay? Because you're going to get so deep that the breath actually stops. So you need to keep them separate. At the beginning, though, it might help
```

```ad-quote
So you might be finding a particular key that works for you, but it's really got a larger context of, again, if you're a chef, you're just, "This needs a bit more" - whatever the _mettā_ would be, pepper or whatever. It just needs a bit more, and you're just adding.
