### Jhanas in the Pali Canon
##### Vocabulary: jhanas are a subset of samadhi

```ad-quote
_Jhānas_ are a subset of _samādhi_, if you like. And _samādhi_ - it's actually quite hard to define, but it's something like a state of harmonious well-being of mind and body.

maybe most people, really need to forget the whole question that goes on: "Do I have it now? Is this it? Am I in a _jhāna_, or am I out of a _jhāna_ ?" And focus, rather, on enjoying, on just really maximizing your enjoyment
```

##### You should be excited
<span class="counts">**[[1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^4-7|4-7]]**: _[[Jhanas]] (3) · [[Happiness]]_</span>

We're really talking about "Wow, wow," something very, very beautiful, something really exciting. And you _should_ be excited. I _like_ people to be excited about practice. It's a good sign. It's a healthy sign.

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=18:16]]

```ad-quote
Why all this contradiction? Well, because the nature of all things is that we can look at them in different ways. That's partly what it means to say they're empty: you can look at it like that, and it's true; you can look at it like _that_, and it's true. And those can sometimes even be opposites. But partly also just because different people at different times, or the same person at different times - sometimes they need to hear _this_, and sometimes they need to hear _that_, regarding the same issue. And it might be opposite.
```

### Mastery
#### Definitions of "Mastery"
##### "Mastery" is familiarity, artistry and accessibility
<span class="counts">**[[1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^5-5|5-5]]**: _[[Jhanas]] (10) · [[Manifestations]] · [[Breath]] · [[Citta]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=18:59]]

```ad-quote
I would like us to aim, or to think about 'mastering' each _jhāna_. What I mean by that is a few different components to that. I mean a really thorough familiarity with all the _jhānas_.
```

```ad-quote
I'm including in that meaning, really, a whole set of skills, a whole kind of artistry that's involved with regard to that _jhāna,_ in terms of working.
```

```ad-quote
The cells and the _citta_ just remember it, and you just have a subtle intention, and it comes back.
```

```ad-info
"mastery" in Pali maybe _kovida_, see https://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?t=30204
```

```ad-note
TODO: collect "mastery" definitions
```

##### With practice, intending a particular jhana doesn't need to be preceded by anything particular

##### Mastery includes staying in a particular jhana in any posture; "marinate" in it
<span class="counts">**[[1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Jhanas]] (5) · [[Citta]] · [[Habit]] (3) · [[Mind]] · [[Embodiment]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=21:36]]

```ad-quote
We need to sit in a _jhāna_ a long time. It's doing a lot of work on the cells, on the being, on the _citta_. It's fine to go through for two seconds on the way - that's all fine, but the real work happens when we really just get in and sit there for a long time, and really let that change our habits, our mental habits, and our energetic habits.
```

---
##### Mastery also means navigating
<span class="counts">**[[1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Jhanas]] (2)_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=23:08]]

##### Mastery also means that I can modulate
<span class="counts">**[[1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Jhanas]] (8) · [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] · [[Experience]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=23:33]]

```ad-quote
if we go back to this idea that a _jhāna_ isn't really one thing - it's a territory. It's a realm. And like a lot of realms, it has different (as I said) flavours, aspects, regions, levels. And I can modulate, move between those different levels, and actually, eventually, also bring in other qualities to mix with it, like mixing cocktails.
```

```ad-quote
don't erect a whole sign that "That's _the first_ jhāna." You say, "Okay, I think this is first _jhāna_, but let's just put a Post-it label now."
```

##### Mastery comes from playing in that playground that's on my edge
<span class="counts">**[[1218 An Introduction to the Jhanas#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Jhanas]]_</span>

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=25:04]]

```ad-quote
we are where we are, and the way I'm going to get mastery is by playing in that playground that's on my edge.
```

```ad-quote
And at a certain time, when I get that mastery, then the playground just shifts - either by itself, or I just have to a little bit shift it. And then I'm in a new playground. That's my work. That's my play.
```

![[20191218-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-an_introduction_to_the_jhanas-60869.mp3#t=27:01]]

```ad-quote
Sometimes the mind will just do something that you think, "Wow, that's amazing," you know? So yes, mostly this idea about mastery and playgrounds, and _sometimes_ - again, some people, at different times, it's like, just _try_ something that feels it's beyond you.
```

#### Jhanas as treasury realms
##### Jhanas are amazing dimensions of being, already there

```ad-quote
the _jhānas_ - they're almost like dimensions of being, if you like. They're beautiful, amazing dimensions of being, treasures, treasure realms, enchanted realms. And they're there, and they're available for us. And this becomes a part of one's life, and a part of one's sense of what existence _is_ and what the cosmos includes.
```

```ad-quote
And one gets to feel that they're realms that are kind of 'already there.' They already exist.
```

##### That the realms already exists becomes obvious in the third jhana

```ad-quote
it's only that we need to _find_ them. They're _there_. Or they're like radio stations, like frequencies.
```

```ad-quote
they're like radio stations. They're in the air anyway. So it begins to be, it's not like I'm huffing and puffing to make this _jhāna_ happen. It's like they're _there_. And what we're doing is tuning to something that's already there.

```ad-quote
We want it to work on the being. We have to linger. We have to live there. We have to, as I said, marinate, absorb - not just _get_ absorbed, but almost absorb the _jhāna_ itself into our being, get to know it intimately, so that the cells, the mind, the habit patterns of mind, etc., and energy are affected. And in that way it makes a really long-term difference to one's life

if there is an extraordinary opening to well-being or different kinds of well-being, if there's a really deep sense of different kinds of beauty, if there's a really profound sense of resource that's coming from that, if the practice of whatever it is you're doing brings, in an integrated way, insight and freedom, and it makes sense as part of the path in an integrated way, then _if_ we need to make definitions and demarcations, that would seem pretty good to call that a _jhāna_, right?

if freedom comes out of it and a capacity more and more to let go, to be okay with more and more, if transformation comes, if insight that liberates comes, and the insight that comes is congruent and integrated into the path - all that, it's like, that's the package that I want to encourage.
