![[20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-orienting_to_this_jhana_retreat-60865.mp3#t=08:36]]

```ad-quote
We have to get the view right (the view is the platform), and the whole relationship right. So if I say something like that - "Oh, the Buddha said, '_Jhānas_ depend on happiness'" - that should set you thinking. Well, I see some of you writing it down. It's important.
```

---
##### (practical issues)
<span class="counts">[[1217 Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#^3-3|3-3]]</span>

---
##### "Open schedule" means that it's on you to find a working temporal structure

```ad-quote
The onus is on you to be responsive and sensitive to your practice, and the needs, and the ebbs and flows, and the ups and downs, and "What is needed right now? Do I need to go out and do some walking? Do I need to sit longer with whatever is happening? Do I need to actually go for a walk, and open my mind, and touch the beauty, and be touched by beauty? Do I need a cup of tea?"
```

```ad-quote
"We're not into brittle _jhānas._ We're not into brittle _samādhi_."

##### Find your playground at your edge
<span class="counts">**[[1217 Orienting to This Jhana Retreat#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Jhanas]] (2)_</span>

![[20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-orienting_to_this_jhana_retreat-60865.mp3#t=18:05]]

```ad-quote
"Where is the edge that I'm kind of learning new stuff? I've mastered _this_," and I'll explain what I mean by 'mastery' - "I've mastered _this_ before, and now this is my edge. I can kind of get it sometimes. It's not what I really have, you know, what's just no hope of doing. It's at my edge." And that becomes your playground. That's where you hang out most, and that's where you work, and that's where you play, and that's where you learn.
```

---
##### Two months of retreat time is not too much to learn one jhana

Pacing is really important. It's part of the art.

![[20191217-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-orienting_to_this_jhana_retreat-60865.mp3#t=22:01]]

```ad-quote
this idea of 'playground' is really important to how things are going to kind of ferment in a way that's going to be really fruitful - how the seeds are going to get planted so that they really bear lovely, nourishing, lifelong, nourishing fruit.
```

---
##### You can jump right into the playground

```ad-quote
"How do we _get_ that _pīti_ to arise?" Or "How do we _allow_ that _pīti_ to arise?" is a better way of putting it. The lovely news is _pīti_ is just like Newton Abbot.
```

```ad-quote
Meaning that it doesn't really matter how that _pīti_ arises, and I would say _anything_ goes.

It means it's not just the joy in someone else's happiness. It _is_ that, and it's all those things I just talked about as well. That's what _muditā_ means in its broader sense, and that's, I think, how the Buddha meant it.
```

You need a fantasy of yourself as a practitioner - you know, a juicy, soulmaking, beautiful image fantasy of yourself, something that's operating in the background, a fantasy of the tradition.

Fantasy of the whole tradition; it's all part of it. That's part of your happiness and nourishment.

'fantasy' as opposed to 'image.' They're almost subliminal. They're just kind of really nourishing and supporting, lubricating our whole sense of what we're doing, giving moisture there, giving beauty and depth.

Yes, _you,_ as an individual, your presence, your character, your soul, your vibe. Don't assume you're irrelevant. Don't assume you don't make a difference. Don't assume that in silence you don't make a difference.

```ad-quote
Like so many things, _jhānas_ lead to malleability. Guess what? Malleability leads to _jhānas._ In other words, it's a condition for _jhānas_. So malleability now is the opposite of inertia.
```

```ad-quote
You won't access _jhānas_ unless you're willing to be malleable, and you play and you play, and get into trying different things. You've got to be, in a way, practising on your toes, ready, responsive.
```

When I say '_jhāna_ practice,' I mean also working with the difficulties, the yucky stuff, the sludge, and slogging away through it, etc. I mean also, when I say '_jhāna_ practice,' the whole relationship with practice, the whole view of the self doing the practice, and trying to do the practice.

```

```ad-quote

There's a range of view, and we're skilled in many different approaches and perspectives regarding the emotions.
