```ad-quote
So this is quite interesting. Sometimes also the reason we are not so attracted to the idea of equanimity is that we have come to feel and believe that our sense of some juice in life, of juiciness, is wrapped up in drama - in the drama of the self, the drama of getting or getting rid of, of some difficulty or this or that - and when that drama dies down a bit, we're a little bit unsure if what will remain will be a bit grey or a bit boring. It's hard to imagine that maybe equanimity, true equanimity, actually has a quality of juiciness in it.
