```ad-info
Each retreat is a series of talks, grouped in their own folder. The "Table of Contents" pages like this one are named:

[year] [name of series]

where the [name of series] comes from the name on Dharmaseed (in UK spelling) and the year is the one of the first talk in the series.

Pages like this one currently do at least:
- link to the Dharmaseed audio
- link to the talks (in the "Talks" section below)

Some talks are already more complete, adding:
- retreats and other talks linked from the talks of the series
- links to practice guides

In the near future, I'd like to see further elements on the TOC page:
- master index, i.e. all index entries (keywords) from all talks, collected in one list (like the ones below the "Index" header in the summaries)
- summary across all talks, i.e. an abstract of what the series is about


```

### Talks
- ✔️ [[Equanimity (talk)]] - - contains **further info boxes** which explain how this Digital Garden works
- ✔️ [[1231 Views in Practice - They Make All the Difference]] (transcript, no summary generated)
