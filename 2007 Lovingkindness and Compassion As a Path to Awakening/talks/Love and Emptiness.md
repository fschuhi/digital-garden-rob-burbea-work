```ad-quote
But sometimes, a different sense of it is visible, which is that we're actually getting out of the way. We're doing less and less. And in that doing less and less, we are building less and less, building less and less barriers. And there's the love there...
```

---
##### Dharmas is stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^3-5|3-5]]**: _[[Dharma]] (2) · [[Awareness]] (2)_</span>

```ad-quote
Dharma is one of these words that can have a lot of different meanings. I think what it means here is what we were doing this morning: experiences, objects of awareness, things, stuff that is arising for us, whatever it is; a moment of some object of awareness is a dharma.
```

##### Recap guided meditation - Metta to phenomena
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^3-6|3-6]]**: _[[Metta]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (4) · [[Experience]] (3) · [[Meditation]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Mind]] · [[Love]] (3)_</span>

[[Guided meditation - Metta to phenomena]]

![[20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=14:06]]

---
##### Emphasis was on complete acceptance
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^3-7|3-7]]**: _[[Mahayana]] · [[Love]] (2) · [[Compassion]] (3) · [[Metta]] · [[Meditation]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Awareness]] (3) · [[Acceptance]] (3)_</span>

```ad-warning
in a lot of the Mahāyāna teachings, they dispense at one level with the words 'love' and 'compassion.' They just use one word, 'compassion,' to mean mettā and compassion.
```

```ad-quote
And there's complete welcoming, complete acceptance. So what's being emphasized here is the love, the acceptance. Absolute, radical acceptance. Not, as in a usual vipassanā practice or awareness practice, the precision, the clarity: "What exactly is going on? Can I see it moment to moment to moment?"
```

---
##### With mindfulness practice, there's both emphasis on precision and acceptence, here: more the welcoming of the experience
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] · [[Acceptance]] (2) · [[Metta]] · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Consciousness]]_</span>

##### Relaxing back into a space of metta

```ad-quote
There's nowhere outside of acceptance. There's nowhere outside of love. So if we feel resistance, if we feel non-acceptance, if we feel judging, if we feel numb - whatever it is, the love, the space of love, can just be bigger, bigger than that, and see that, too, and embrace that, too, and bathe that, too, in the kindness, in the complete welcoming. And this welcoming has to be, this total welcoming has to be as genuine as possible.
```

---
####  Emptiness
##### The fleeting nature of experience deserves our compassion
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^4-3|4-3]]**: _[[Experience]] (4) · [[Nature]] · [[Compassion]] (2)_</span>

---
##### Experience begin to fade

![[20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=19:04]]

---
##### The practice is not about being in the present moment, but rather feeding what's beautiful and investigation
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[Phenomenon]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Emptiness]] · [[Present moment]] · [[Buddha]] · [[Kusala]] (2) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Freedom]] (2)_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^5-1|5-1]]**: _[[Freedom]] · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Samadhi]] · [[Metta]] · [[Insight]]_</span>

---
##### With insight meditation there is the assumption that mindfulness is neutral

##### But the mind is coloroud with anger, metta, romantic love
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Anger]] (3) · [[Perception]] (3) · [[Metta]] (7) · [[Mind]] (3) · [[Romantic love]] · [[Mind state]] · [[Mindfulness]]_</span>

```ad-quote
Mind always has some mind state. So with [mindfulness](app://obsidian.md/mindfulness), there's always _some_ degree of something on the range from complete unconditioned bliss of loving-kindness to rage. The mind will be somewhere along that spectrum. It _has_ to be.
```

---
##### There's a spectrum, and the mind is always somewhere on that spectrum, so what is "real"?
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^5-4|5-4]]**: _[[Mindfulness]] · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Mind]] · [[Love]]_</span>

---
##### Our relationship with experience is on a spectrum between peace or struggle
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Insight]] (2) · [[Experience]] (2) · [[Mindfulness]] · [[Breath]] · [[Attention]] · [[Dharma]]_</span>

---
##### A thing cannot be experienced as a problem unless I am in an unskilful relationship to it
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Love]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Experience]] (3) · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Dharma]] · [[Insight]]_</span>

##### Even oneness is not how things really are, it's also dependend on conditions
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-1|7-1]]**: _[[Emptiness]] (2) · [[Oneness]] (4) · [[Mind]] · [[Insight]] · [[Perception]] · [[Love]] (2)_</span>

---
##### But don't be in a hurry, as the power of those kinds of perceptions transforms heart and mind
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-2|7-2]]**: _[[Emptiness]] · [[Oneness]] (2) · [[Love]] (2) · [[Perception]] (4) · [[Experience]] · [[Mind]] · [[Fabrication]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Ways of looking]]_</span>

```ad-quote
Human consciousness is programmed incredibly strongly to go to that default mode. What we begin to see in practice is that default way of seeing is not the reality. If we throw out what I would call the deeper senses of oneness, of an infinite love, whatever you want to call it, if we throw that out too quickly, we just go back to the default, and in a way, we're not challenging that default mode enough.
```

---
##### ..."By not holding to fixed views" - the liberation comes through how ways of seeing are fabricated
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-3|7-3]]**: _[[Metta Sutta]] · [[Metta]] (2) · [[Awakening]] (3) · [[Nondualism]] · [[Oneness]] · [[Love]] · [[Consciousness]] · [[Insight]] · [[Perception]] · [[Ways of looking]] · [[Fabrication]]_</span>

##### The Middle Way points to neither existence, nor non-existence, nor some kind of compromise
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^7-4|7-4]]**: _[[Emptiness]] · [[Middle Way]]_</span>

---
##### Seeing into emptiness is seeing into freedom
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-1|8-1]]**: _[[Emptiness]] (2) · [[Freedom]]_</span>

---
##### Example: "What I want" colouring the meditation practice

##### Changing the perception can make the irritability go away from the situation
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-3|8-3]]**: _[[Samadhi]] · [[Love]] (2) · [[Perception]] · [[Mind]] (2) · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]]_</span>

```ad-quote
So what we notice is, if we change the view, the perception changes. The irritability goes from the situation. How we see the situation and how we see a person depends on what the mind is bringing to it - mettā, compassion, irritability, what I want, whatever it is. And the mind's always bringing something.
```

---
##### Fear is not existing independently, but also dependend on the reaction to it
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-4|8-4]]**: _[[Fear]] (7) · [[Mind]] · [[Anger]] · [[Perception]] (2)_</span>

![[20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=40:29]]

---
##### If I believe in the present as something real, independent of the mind, there will be fear of the future
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^8-5|8-5]]**: _[[Fear]] (4) · [[Present moment]] · [[Mind]] (2) · [[Buddha]]_</span>

---
##### Past, present and future are empty
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^9-1|9-1]]**: _[[Mind state]] (2) · [[Fear]]_</span>

```ad-quote
The past is coloured by the present mind state.
```

```ad-quote
If I don't really believe in the present, I can't really believe in the future, and I can't really believe in fear. I can't really believe in the power of that.
```

---
##### "Compassion without any object of reference" in the traditions
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^9-2|9-2]]**: _[[Aksayamati Sutra]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Love]] (4) · [[Emptiness]] · [[Rumi]] · [[Tibetan Buddhism]] · [[Mahayana]] · [[Vajrayana]] · [[Compassion]]_</span>

```ad-quote
So, you know, the analogy of, there's the mountain, and there's the peak of the mountain, and that's where we're headed, but the step is right here, right now. And we can see where we're going, and pay attention to where we are right now. And it's both. It's finding a sensitive balance of that.
```

##### When there's no clinging and grasping, wee feel the suffering go out of experience
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^9-5|9-5]]**: _[[Emptiness]] (2) · [[Love]] (5) · [[Equanimity]] · [[Craving]] (6) · [[Clinging]] (4) · [[Insight]] · [[Dependent Origination]] (3) · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Experience]]_</span>

##### Grasping makes the way the world appears
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^10-1|10-1]]**: _[[Insight]] · [[Dependent Origination]] · [[Craving]] (2)_</span>

![[20070204-Rob_Burbea-GAIA-love_and_emptiness-12293.mp3#t=49:00]]

```ad-quote
But we begin to see: the appearance of something depends on the grasping. So there is no thing, there is no real thing that is independent of grasping, of clinging, of what the mind is doing with it. No thing, no problem. If a thing isn't real, it can't be a real problem.
```

##### Grasping clouds our seeing
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^10-3|10-3]]**: _[[Love]] (2) · [[Craving]] (4) · [[Impermanence]] · [[Emptiness]]_</span>

```ad-quote
Seeing emptiness leads to love and compassion, because it's kind of done away with the reality of separation, with the reality of barriers, with the reality of real problems, real faults, with the investment we have in self-inflating or self-depreciation.
```

---
##### Paradoxically, seeing that even that suffering doesn't really exist, somehow leads to even more love and compassion
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^10-5|10-5]]**: _[[Nihilism]] · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Love]] · [[Compassion]]_</span>

<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^11-1|11-1]]**: _[[Love]] (7) · [[Consciousness]] (3) · [[Nature]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]]_</span>

```ad-quote
It's not that we're always going to stay in one state or another. It's something about being human, the amazing range of human consciousness. It's staggering, the capacity of the range of human consciousness to move along that whole spectrum. And somehow in that, and in accepting that movement, that's where our humanity is and our humility is.
```

### Q&A

<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^11-4|11-4]]**: _[[Metta]]_</span>

---
##### Rob: Yes (and possibilities)
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^11-6|11-6]]**: _[[Metta]] (3) · [[Consciousness]] (2) · [[Image]] · [[Dharma]] · [[Experience]] · [[Relationships]] · [[Embodiment]] · [[Emotions]]_</span>

- giving the tree metta as a tree, as a sentient being
- metta to the image in consciousness as dharma

```ad-quote
So experiment. What I think I'm interested in is beginning to see this relationship. So don't always go where perhaps the relationship is harder to see. Spend some time where you really begin to see, "Ah, there's something going on here.""

<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^13-1|13-1]]**: _[[Anatta]] · [[Acceptance]] · [[Love]]_</span>

```ad-quote
when I say, "If I'm loving myself, what am I?", one level of looking at it in terms of anattā is, I am just these experiences and my relationship with them. If that becomes one of more acceptance for all that, then it's a kind of self-love, absolutely.
```

```ad-quote
So it's just whatever's in consciousness, whatever's prominent, there the mettā goes. And also quite quick to see what the relationship with things is. With practice, it just becomes very evident: there's some slight aversion here. And it's clear, and then the mettā comes in or the compassion or whatever.

```ad-quote
There's a kind of grasping that goes on with attention. But we can also see that we can be paying attention to something, and then when we let go of a lot of grasping, that thing that we're paying attention to actually begins to blur and to fade... Grasping is part of perception... No grasping, no perception.

```ad-quote
My take on it, as well, is that a person can be awakened to some degree, and there's basically a momentum of saṅkhāras, of karmic momentum, to basically perceive things and things existing really. And that momentum for the duration of their life is enough to keep the world appearing for them. And then, theoretically, when they die, it all kind of dissolves into whatever it does.

##### Rob: Language is stopped short
<span class="counts">**[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^16-9|16-9]]**: _[[Awareness]] (3)_</span>

```ad-warning
title: terminology
```

In [[Phenomenology]] (the branch of Continental Philosophy), consciousness is always "intentional", i.e. directed towards an object. Rob intentionally (no pun intended) conflates "awareness" and "consciousness", so viewed from the conceptual framework of phenomenology, an awareness without an object would not only not be possible but impossible by definition. Rob skillfully avoids terminology wars here.

<span class="counts">[[0204 Love and Emptiness#^17-10|17-10]]</span>

```ad-quote
As I said, they will blend and bleed into each other. There is something that comes with just really developing one and staying with one and letting that go through its range, just having one kind of intention. One level, they do blend into each other, and they're mixed, and it's kind of all the same thing anyway; why bother making a difference? On another level, we do want to be - there's a slight difference, and we want to be sensitive to it.
