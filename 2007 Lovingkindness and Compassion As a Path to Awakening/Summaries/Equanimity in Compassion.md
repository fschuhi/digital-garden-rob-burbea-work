**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-4|1-4]]**: _[[Equanimity]] (2)_

---
##### The heart and mind stay steady through their contact with all things in life
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-5|1-5]]**: _[[Steadiness]] (2) · [[Equanimity]] · [[Buddha]]_

---
##### Equanimity makes the compassion steady in the face of suffering
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^1-6|1-6]]**: _[[Compassion]] (4) · [[Dukkha]] (7) · [[Depression]] · [[Equanimity]]_

---
##### This talk is about how equanimity feeds into the compassion practice
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-1|2-1]]**: _[[Equanimity]] · [[Compassion]] (2)_

---
##### (1) Opening the heart to resonate with the suffering we see (empathy)

**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-3|2-3]]**: _[[Compassion]] · [[Energy]] (2) · [[Dukkha]] · [[Grief]] · [[Beauty]] · [[Healing]]_

```ad-quote
So sometimes it will feel like we're very much in the 'feeling the sorrow' side, where very much there's quite some sadness, or grief, or just being moved. And sometimes it can be very lovely, and there's a sweetness to it, there's a beauty to it; the heart is open and touched. And sometimes it feels like the balance is more, we're just feeling in, tuning into that energy that's going out - the lovely quality of healing, of light, the balm, the comforting.
```

---
#### Balance
##### The outflow of compassion from us to others touches us, and we feel healed
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-4|2-4]]**: _[[Healing]] (3) · [[Pleasantness]] (2) · [[Happiness]]_

```ad-quote
What's going out, the comforting, the balm, it actually has a feeling of feeling pleasant, and of feeling quite healing. So in coming out of our being, it's actually touching us on its way out to others. And we feel healed.
```
---

**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-5|2-5]]**: _[[Grief]] (2) · [[Compassion]] · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Death]]_

---
##### It's part of our humanity to be touched
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^2-6|2-6]]**: _[[Grief]]_

```ad-quote
It's part of our humanity to be touched. We're not, in a way, wanting to be untouched and inhuman. It gives the heart a quality of some kind of opening, some kind of tenderness that's really important.
```

---
##### Equanimity means  buoyancy, not to sink underneath the weight of the suffering
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-1|3-1]]**: _[[Compassion]] (4) · [[Dukkha]] (2) · [[Cultivation]] · [[Happiness]] (2) · [[Equanimity]] (2) · [[Steadiness]]_

---
#### Samadhi
##### Don't underestimate the power of samadhi in the deepening of equanimity
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-2|3-2]]**: _[[Equanimity]] (2) · [[Samadhi]] (5) · [[Retreat]] · [[Steadiness]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]]_

---
##### Story: last year's retreatant who didn't want to do samadhi, pointing to the busyness of life
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-3|3-3]]**: _[[Samadhi]] (3) · [[Compassion]]_

---
##### Samadhi allows any quality to sink into the cells
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-4|3-4]]**: _[[Samadhi]] (2) · [[Insight]] · [[Metta]] · [[Compassion]] (2)_

```ad-quote
sink into the cells, and to be there, woven in almost to the fabric of our being
```

---
##### But it's also important to practice when the mind isn't that settled
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-5|3-5]]**: _[[Samadhi]]_

---
##### The natural progression of samadhi leads to equanimity, which eventually becomes also accessible outside samadhi
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^3-6|3-6]]**: _[[Samadhi]] (3) · [[Equanimity]] (3) · [[Piti]] · [[Happiness]]_

```ad-quote
This is usually a progression that takes months and months, but in the progression of that, the equanimity, too, gets kind of sewn into the being
```

---
#### The Self
##### How much is the self _doing_ the compassion practice
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^4-1|4-1]]**: _[[Samadhi]] · [[The Self]] (3) · [[Compassion]] (4) · [[Retreat]]_

---
##### As the self-sense gets quite, equanimity becomes the natural state
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^4-2|4-2]]**: _[[The Self]] (7) · [[Compassion]] (2) · [[Equanimity]] (4)_

---
#### Spaciousness
##### With spaciousness, any suffering can be held effortlessly in that space

---
##### Still, the self giving compassion is a necessary aspect of our humanity
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^4-5|4-5]]**: _[[The Self]] · [[Compassion]] (5) · [[Dukkha]]_

---
#### Limits of compassion practice
##### "What do I want or need for myself here?"
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^4-6|4-6]]**: _[[Samadhi]] · [[The Self]] · [[Spaciousness]] · [[Compassion]]_

---
##### It's challenging to care for someone who is clearly causing suffering for themselves

---
##### Am I finding a way to care of my needs?
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-2|5-2]]**: _[[Metta]] · [[Compassion]] · [[Relationships]]_

---
##### Co-dependence can happen
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^5-3|5-3]]**: _[[Compassion]]_

---
##### We might want some recognition for our efforts

**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-2|6-2]]**: _[[Equanimity]] · [[Dependent Origination]] (2) · [[Freedom]]_

---
##### Example: Dharma talk
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-3|6-3]]**: _[[Dharma]] (4) · [[Experience]] · [[Dependent Origination]]_

---
##### Maybe it's just a see
**[[0208 Equanimity in Compassion#^6-4|6-4]]**: _[[Desire]] · [[Dependent Origination]]_

```ad-quote
But mostly it's actually just a little drop, and then one goes out into that infinite web of conditions in the life. Maybe it's just a seed. It meets another condition, then it begins to sprout. Maybe it sprouts a little here, and then it gets watered. Maybe it meets the wrong conditions and it just gets covered over, you know?
```

---
